# Band MCP Server

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11%2B-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)
![MCP Protocol](https://img.shields.io/badge/MCP-1.0-purple)

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server that provides seamless integration with the Band AI platform. Enable AI agents to interact with Band's agent management, chat rooms, and messaging systems.

## ✨ Features

- Dual-scope tool surface: serve agent tools (`--scope agent`), human tools (`--scope human`), or both
- Opt-in contact directory (`--tools contacts`), memory (`--tools memory`), and task-board (`--tools tasks`) tool groups
- Room pinning with `--room-id` — hides the room field from the advertised schema and injects it at call time
- STDIO transport for IDE integration; SSE transport for Docker and remote deployments
- Tool definitions sourced from `band-sdk` so the MCP stays in lockstep with the platform SDK

## Migrating from pre-v1.2.0

Every tool name changed. Tools are now prefixed with `band_`, and the agent surface was reshaped when the handwritten handlers were deleted in favor of the SDK-driven registrar. If you whitelist tool names in your MCP client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, LangChain `tools=[...]`), expect breakage until you update them.

Notable behavior changes:

- Contact tools are no longer registered by default. Pass `--tools contacts` to restore them.
- `get_agent_me`, `list_agent_chats`, and message-lifecycle tools (`mark_agent_message_*`) have been removed. `AgentTools` is room-scoped via the SDK; agent identity travels with the credential.
- A handful of agent tools were renamed beyond the prefix (`create_agent_chat` → `band_create_chatroom`, `list_agent_peers` → `band_lookup_peers`, etc.).
- All `THENVOI_*` environment variables have been dropped with **no fallback** — set the `BAND_*` equivalent before upgrading, or the server starts with empty credentials (`ConfigError` at best, 401s at worst):

  | Old (`THENVOI_*`) | New (`BAND_*`) |
  | --- | --- |
  | `THENVOI_API_KEY` | *(removed — set `BAND_USER_KEY` and/or `BAND_AGENT_KEY`)* |
  | `THENVOI_BASE_URL` | `BAND_BASE_URL` |
  | `THENVOI_USER_KEY` | `BAND_USER_KEY` |
  | `THENVOI_AGENT_KEY` | `BAND_AGENT_KEY` |
  | `THENVOI_MCP_SCOPE` | `BAND_MCP_SCOPE` |
  | `THENVOI_MCP_TOOLS` | `BAND_MCP_TOOLS` |
  | `THENVOI_MCP_ROOM_ID` | `BAND_MCP_ROOM_ID` |

  The single-key `BAND_API_KEY` path (a later, separate fallback added after
  the `THENVOI_*` rename) has also been removed — there is no unscoped
  credential any more. Set `BAND_USER_KEY` (human scope) and/or
  `BAND_AGENT_KEY` (agent scope) explicitly.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Band API key from [app.band.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.band.ai/settings/api-keys)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install band-mcp
# or, if you use uv
uv tool install band-mcp
```

This installs the `band-mcp` CLI on your PATH. No repo clone, no `uv` directory flags, no absolute paths required.

> **Getting Your API Key**
>
> 1. Log in to [Band](https://app.band.ai)
> 2. Navigate to **Settings → API Keys**
> 3. Click **Create New API Key**
> 4. Copy the key immediately (won't be shown again)

## 📦 Install in Your IDE

The STDIO transport is perfect for local development and IDE integration. The server starts automatically when your AI assistant needs it.

### IDE Integration

Configure your AI assistant to use the Band MCP Server with the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "band": {
      "command": "band-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--scope",
        "agent,human",
        "--tools",
        "contacts"
      ],
      "env": {
        "BAND_AGENT_KEY": "band_a_your_agent_key",
        "BAND_USER_KEY": "band_u_your_user_key",
        "BAND_BASE_URL": "https://app.band.ai"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** This assumes `band-mcp` is installed via `pip` or `uv tool install` so the `band-mcp` command is on your PATH. If you prefer to run from a local checkout, see the [Development setup](#-development) section.

> See the Configuration section below for the breaking-change note about `--tools contacts`.

### Manual Testing (STDIO)

For testing or standalone usage without an IDE:

```bash
# After installing band-mcp from PyPI
BAND_AGENT_KEY=your-agent-key band-mcp

# Or, from a local checkout
uv run band-mcp
```

**Expected output:**

```
2025-11-19 17:09:51,621 - band-mcp - INFO - Starting band-mcp-server v1.3.2
2025-11-19 17:09:51,621 - band-mcp - INFO - Base URL: https://app.band.ai
2025-11-19 17:09:51,621 - band-mcp - INFO - Server ready - listening for MCP protocol messages on STDIO
```

> **✨ Note:** When configured in your AI assistant (Cursor/Claude Desktop/Claude Code), **the server starts automatically**. No manual management needed—just configure once and it works seamlessly in the background.

### SSE Transport Mode (Remote/Docker Deployments)

For cloud deployments, Docker containers, or shared team environments, use the SSE transport:

```bash
# Start SSE server on default port 8000
band-mcp --transport sse

# Custom host and port
band-mcp --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 3000
```

**Expected output:**

```
2025-12-18 17:15:55 - band-mcp - INFO - Starting band-mcp-server v1.3.2
2025-12-18 17:15:55 - band-mcp - INFO - Base URL: https://app.band.ai
2025-12-18 17:15:55 - band-mcp - INFO - Transport: SSE (HTTP server mode)
2025-12-18 17:15:55 - band-mcp - INFO - Server ready - listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
2025-12-18 17:15:55 - band-mcp - INFO - SSE endpoint: /sse | Messages endpoint: /messages/
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

#### Testing SSE Mode with curl

SSE requires maintaining a persistent connection. Use three terminals:

**Terminal 1 - Start the server:**

```bash
band-mcp --transport sse --port 3000
```

**Terminal 2 - Connect to SSE stream (keep running):**

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:3000/sse
```

You'll receive a session ID:

```
event: endpoint
data: /messages/?session_id=abc123def456...
```

**Terminal 3 - Send requests (use the session ID from Terminal 2):**

```bash
# 1. Initialize the connection (required first)
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:3000/messages/?session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}'

# 2. List available tools
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:3000/messages/?session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}'

# 3. Call a tool (e.g., health_check)
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:3000/messages/?session_id=YOUR_SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"health_check","arguments":{}}}'
```

> **Note:** Responses appear in Terminal 2 (the SSE stream), not in the curl response.

#### Environment Variables for SSE

You can also configure via environment variables:

```bash
export TRANSPORT=sse
export HOST=0.0.0.0
export PORT=3000
band-mcp
```

### Testing with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector band-mcp
```

## 🔨 Available Tools

Tool definitions live in [`band-sdk`](https://github.com/band-ai/band-sdk-python) (see `band.runtime.tools.iter_tool_definitions`). The MCP server enumerates them at startup based on `--scope` and `--tools`. Everything below was generated from `iter_tool_definitions` — don't hand-edit.

Tool counts:

| Scope   | Baseline | +`--tools contacts` | +`--tools memory` | +`--tools tasks` |
| ------- | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `agent` | 7        | +5                  | +5                | +7                |
| `human` | 13       | +9                  | +6                | —                 |

### 🤖 Agent tools (`--scope agent`)

## 💡 Using band-mcp with an Agent Framework

`band-mcp` speaks stock MCP over STDIO or SSE, so it works with any MCP-aware
client library — [`langchain-mcp-adapters`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters),
LangGraph's `MultiServerMCPClient`, or a framework's own MCP tool loader.
Point the client at the `band-mcp` command (STDIO) or a running
`band-mcp --transport sse` process (SSE), then load its tools like any other
MCP server — no Band-specific glue code beyond the credentials in
[Configuration](#-configuration) below.

For an end-to-end worked example instead of a from-scratch integration, see
the Docker Compose and sandbox setups under
[`examples/acp/copilot_docker`](https://github.com/band-ai/band-sdk-python/tree/main/examples/acp/copilot_docker)
and
[`examples/acp/copilot_sandbox`](https://github.com/band-ai/band-sdk-python/tree/main/examples/acp/copilot_sandbox),
which run `band-mcp` over SSE alongside a real agent.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Credentials and scope (new in v1.2.0)

`band-mcp` now takes explicit dual credentials and lets operators pick which
scopes and tool groups to serve:

```bash
# One credential per scope
export BAND_USER_KEY=band_u_your_user_key
export BAND_AGENT_KEY=band_a_your_agent_key

# Serve both scopes in one process (default: agent only)
uv run band-mcp --scope agent,human

# Opt into contact-directory / memory / task-board tools
uv run band-mcp --scope agent --tools contacts,memory,tasks

# Pin the whole server to a single chat/room
uv run band-mcp --scope agent --room-id r_123
```

Resolution precedence per field: `CLI flag > BAND_* env`. There is no
single-key fallback — a credential is either scope-specific or absent.

**Breaking change note for `--tools`.** Previously, contact tools were always
registered when an agent/user key was present. The new default is `--tools []`
(no optional groups). Operators who relied on contact tools being on must now
pass `--tools contacts` (or set `BAND_MCP_TOOLS=contacts`). Memory tools
remain opt-in via `--tools memory`.

Unknown `--scope` / `--tools` values are logged at WARN with a "did you mean?" hint. Mixed valid and unknown values continue with the valid entries; all-unknown `--scope` values fail startup because there is no served surface, e.g.:

```
WARN  unknown --tools value 'contact' — did you mean 'contacts'? ignoring.
WARN  unknown --scope value 'huamn' — did you mean 'human'? ignoring.
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable             | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `BAND_USER_KEY`      | User (human-scope) API key (`band_u_...`)         |
| `BAND_AGENT_KEY`     | Agent-scope API key (`band_a_...`)                |
| `BAND_MCP_SCOPE`     | Comma-separated scope list (default: `agent`)     |
| `BAND_MCP_TOOLS`     | Opt-in tool groups: `contacts`, `memory`, `tasks` |
| `BAND_MCP_ROOM_ID`   | Pinned room id (optional)                         |
| `BAND_BASE_URL`      | API base URL (default: `https://app.band.ai`)     |
| `TRANSPORT`          | `stdio` (default) or `sse`                        |
| `HOST` / `PORT`      | SSE bind host/port                                |

There is no single unscoped credential — set `BAND_USER_KEY` for the human
scope and/or `BAND_AGENT_KEY` for the agent scope, matching whichever
`--scope` values you serve.

> **Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already in `.gitignore`.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

```bash
# Check Python version (must be 3.11+)
python --version

# Verify the CLI is installed
band-mcp --help

# Try running with debug mode
BAND_LOG_LEVEL=debug band-mcp
```

### Authentication Failures

- Verify your API key is correct and not expired
- Regenerate API key at [app.band.ai/settings/api-keys](https://app.band.ai/settings/api-keys)
- Test API directly:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BAND_AGENT_KEY" \
    https://app.band.ai/api/v1/health
  ```

### AI Assistant Not Detecting Tools

1. Confirm `band-mcp` is on PATH: `which band-mcp`
2. Test server manually: `BAND_AGENT_KEY=... band-mcp`
3. Restart your AI assistant completely
4. Check logs:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
   ```

## 💻 Development

`band-mcp` is published from [`band-ai/band-sdk-python`](https://github.com/band-ai/band-sdk-python)
— it lives at `packages/band-mcp` as a `uv` workspace member of that repo, not
a standalone project. There's no separate clone or wheel-building step: the
workspace resolves `band-sdk` straight from `src/band` in the same checkout,
so an edit there is picked up by `band-mcp` immediately.

### Project Structure

```
packages/band-mcp/
├── src/
│   └── band_mcp/
│       ├── __init__.py    # Package version
│       ├── config.py      # CLI/env resolution, scope/tools parsing
│       ├── server.py      # CLI entry point, EngineSpec construction
│       └── shared.py      # StandaloneResolver: dispatches tool calls to AgentTools/HumanTools
├── mcp_config_example.json
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

Tool *implementations* live one level up, in `band-sdk`
(`src/band/runtime/tools/`, `src/band/integrations/mcp/engine.py`).
`band_mcp` only contains the CLI's transport-layer plumbing: input-schema
extension for room-bound tools, the per-room `AgentTools` cache, and wiring
the resolved `Config` into `build_engine()`. Its own tests live with the rest
of the repo's suite, at `tests/mcp/`.

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the SDK repo (band-mcp is a workspace member of it, not its own repo)
git clone https://github.com/band-ai/band-sdk-python
cd band-sdk-python

# Install dependencies for the whole workspace, including band-mcp
uv sync --extra dev --all-packages

# Run band-mcp from the workspace
BAND_AGENT_KEY=your-agent-key uv run --package band-mcp band-mcp

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run pre-commit install
```

Credentials for local runs come from the repo-root `.env.test` (see the SDK's
`CLAUDE.md` for the full variable list), not a `band-mcp`-local `.env` file.

### Pre-Commit Hooks

Repo-wide, shared with the rest of `band-sdk-python`:

- **Gitleaks:** prevents secrets from being committed
- **Ruff:** linting and formatting
- **Pyrefly:** type checking
- **Commitizen / actionlint:** commit-message and workflow-file linting

The hooks run automatically on `git commit`.

### Running Tests

```bash
# band-mcp's own tests, from the repo root
uv run pytest tests/mcp/ -v

# The whole workspace's unit tests
uv run pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/integration/ --ignore=tests/e2e/ -v

# Lint / format / typecheck (also repo-wide)
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
uv run pyrefly check
```

### Using Context7 MCP for Documentation

[Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) is an MCP server that provides up-to-date documentation for libraries and frameworks. It's highly recommended to use Context7 alongside Band MCP when developing—it helps your AI assistant fetch accurate, current documentation.

#### Adding Context7 to Your MCP Configuration

Add Context7 to your existing MCP configuration alongside Band:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "band": {
      "command": "band-mcp",
      "env": {
        "BAND_AGENT_KEY": "band_a_your_agent_key",
        "BAND_BASE_URL": "https://app.band.ai"
      }
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Context7 requires Node.js and npm/npx to be installed on your system.

#### How to Use Context7

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant to fetch documentation:

- *"Look up the Band REST API documentation with Context7"*

Context7 will retrieve current documentation directly from official sources, ensuring your AI assistant has accurate information when helping you code.
