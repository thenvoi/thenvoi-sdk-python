# A2A Gateway Examples

Examples showing how to expose Thenvoi peers as inbound A2A endpoints.

## Why the gateway exists

The gateway is the inbound side of the Thenvoi A2A story.

- the **bridge** connects a remote A2A agent into Thenvoi
- the **gateway** exposes Thenvoi peers out to external A2A clients

An external A2A client can call the gateway, discover Thenvoi peers through AgentCard routes, and send requests that the gateway turns into Thenvoi room activity.

## Architecture

```text
External A2A Client
        |
        v
   A2A Gateway
        |
        v
 Thenvoi Platform
        |
        v
   Thenvoi Peer
```

Context is preserved by mapping the incoming A2A `contextId` to a Thenvoi room.

## What these examples cover

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_basic_gateway.py` | **Basic gateway** - Start the gateway and expose Thenvoi peers as A2A endpoints. |
| `02_with_demo_agent.py` | **Gateway plus orchestrator** - Run the gateway and a local demo A2A agent that calls gateway peers. |
| `demo_orchestrator/` | Implementation details for the local demo orchestrator agent. |

## What was validated during `INT-245`

- `01_basic_gateway.py` worked live for startup and `/peers`
- per-peer agent card discovery worked live
- a deterministic Thenvoi peer completed a real gateway round-trip
- the gateway reused the same room when the same `context_id` was used
- the README startup flow was re-run after fixing credential selection and local source execution
- `02_with_demo_agent.py` was exercised as the higher-level gateway demo path
- I stopped late reruns once the platform started returning `429` responses on the gateway account, rather than treating that throttling as a gateway SDK failure

## Prerequisites

You need:

- `.env` or `agent_config.yaml` with Thenvoi credentials
- at least one Thenvoi peer available in the workspace
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you want to run the demo orchestrator

Recommended: use `gateway_agent` in `agent_config.yaml`.
The config name must be exactly `gateway_agent`.

```yaml
gateway_agent:
  agent_id: "your-gateway-agent-id"
  api_key: "your-gateway-api-key"
```

Fallback: you can also use environment variables:

```bash
export THENVOI_API_KEY=your-thenvoi-api-key
export THENVOI_AGENT_ID=a2a-gateway
```

## Install

From the repo root:

```bash
uv sync --extra a2a_gateway
```

If you want the orchestrator demo too:

```bash
uv sync --extra a2a_gateway_demo
```

When you run these examples from this repository, `uv run` uses the local checkout of `thenvoi-sdk`.

## Running the basic gateway

```bash
uv run examples/a2a_gateway/01_basic_gateway.py
```

Once it is up, the most useful endpoints are:

- `GET http://localhost:10000/peers`
- `GET http://localhost:10000/agents/<peer-id>/.well-known/agent.json`
- `POST http://localhost:10000/agents/<peer-id>`
- `POST http://localhost:10000/agents/<peer-id>/v1/message:stream`

## Basic smoke test

### 1. Start the gateway

```bash
uv run examples/a2a_gateway/01_basic_gateway.py
```

### 2. List peers

```bash
curl http://localhost:10000/peers
```

Pick one peer id from the response.

### 3. Fetch the peer's agent card

```bash
curl http://localhost:10000/agents/<peer-id>/.well-known/agent.json
```

### 4. Send a message

Use a stable `contextId` so you can test room reuse.

For JSON-RPC clients, send requests to the base agent route:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:10000/agents/<peer-id> \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "1",
    "method": "message/send",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "role": "user",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Hello from an A2A client"}],
        "messageId": "msg-1",
        "contextId": "ctx-1"
      }
    }
  }'
```

If you want the legacy streaming route, send a raw A2A `Message` body instead:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:10000/agents/<peer-id>/v1/message:stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "role": "user",
    "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Hello from an A2A client"}],
    "messageId": "msg-1",
    "contextId": "ctx-1"
  }'
```

What success looks like:

- the gateway accepts the request
- the mapped Thenvoi peer replies
- reusing `contextId: "ctx-1"` continues the same conversation

## Context reuse test

To verify the same `contextId` maps back to the same Thenvoi room:

1. send a first request with `contextId: "ctx-1"`
2. send a second request with the same `contextId`
3. confirm the peer continues the same conversation instead of starting a new room

This is one of the main gateway behaviors worth checking during integration work.

## Running the demo orchestrator

This example starts:

- the gateway on port `10000`
- a local demo A2A orchestrator on port `10001`

Set the model key first:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
uv run examples/a2a_gateway/02_with_demo_agent.py
```

Then check the orchestrator card:

```bash
curl http://localhost:10001/.well-known/agent.json
```

The orchestrator's job is to accept an incoming A2A request and route it to one of the peers exposed by the gateway.

## What success looks like

### Basic gateway

- `/peers` returns real Thenvoi peers
- `/.well-known/agent.json` returns a valid card for a peer
- a message call returns a peer response
- the same `contextId` reuses the same room

### Demo orchestrator

- the orchestrator card is reachable on port `10001`
- a request to the orchestrator is routed through the gateway
- the orchestrator returns the downstream peer response

## Common problems

### `/peers` is empty

Check that:

- your Thenvoi credentials are valid
- the workspace actually has peers to expose

### The gateway fails with a permissions error

Use an agent-scoped credential, not a user-scoped API key.

Use `gateway_agent` from `agent_config.yaml`, which is the safest path for onboarding.

### Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY`

`02_with_demo_agent.py` fails fast with `ValueError` when the orchestrator model key is missing.

### Confusing the bridge and the gateway

Use:

- the **bridge** when you want a remote A2A agent to join Thenvoi rooms
- the **gateway** when you want an external A2A client to talk to Thenvoi peers

### Requests work but context does not persist

Make sure you are reusing the same `contextId` value between requests.

### Port `10000` is already in use

Pick another port for the local run:

```bash
GATEWAY_PORT=10002 GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:10002 uv run examples/a2a_gateway/01_basic_gateway.py
```
