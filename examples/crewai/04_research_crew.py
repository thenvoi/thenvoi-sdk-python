Complete CrewAI-style crew with multiple specialized agents.

This example demonstrates how to run multiple specialized agents as a crew
on the Thenvoi platform. Each agent has a specific role and they collaborate
to accomplish complex tasks.

The crew consists of:
- Research Analyst: Gathers and analyzes information
- Content Writer: Creates clear, engaging content
- Editor: Reviews and refines content for quality

To run the full crew, start each agent in separate terminals:

Terminal 1:
    uv run examples/crewai/04_research_crew.py researcher

Terminal 2:
    uv run examples/crewai/04_research_crew.py writer

Terminal 3:
    uv run examples/crewai/04_research_crew.py editor

Then in the Thenvoi chat, add all agents to the same room and they'll
collaborate on requests.
