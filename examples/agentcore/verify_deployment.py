"""Post-deployment smoke check for the AgentCore demo in this folder.

Run this **once, by hand, after you have deployed the demo**, to confirm the live
deployed system actually orchestrates end-to-end. Exit 0 = the deployment works;
exit 1 = it does not.

What it checks:

- the acceptance flow — a user asks ``@personal_assistant`` a question needing
  both ``@weather`` and ``@math``; PA adds them to the room, asks each what it
  needs, and posts a final synthesized answer;
- per-room session isolation — the same flow run in two concurrent rooms does not
  bleed between them.

What it is NOT:

- **not** a unit/CI test — it needs the externally-deployed AWS infra, so it never
  runs in CI (nothing under ``tests/`` depends on it, and it depends on nothing
  there);
- **not** the demo itself, and **not** how you run the demo — the bridge is
  ``run_agentcore.py`` and the deployed container is ``agentcore_llm_server.py``;
- **not** a general SDK/adapter test — those live in ``tests/e2e/baseline/``.

Prerequisites:

1. ``BAND_REST_URL``, ``BAND_WS_URL``, ``BAND_API_KEY_USER`` — a user account on
   the target platform (this tool connects as the user, not an agent).
2. The demo deployed and running externally:
   - three AgentCore Runtimes (weather / math / personal_assistant);
   - the bridge running with ``BAND_BRIDGE_AGENTS`` pointing at the three
     identities and their runtime ARNs (see ``run_agentcore.py``).
3. ``AGENTCORE_DEMO_PA_AGENT_ID`` — the personal_assistant's Band agent UUID, so
   this tool knows whom to @-mention. (PA recruits the other two at runtime.)
   ``AGENTCORE_DEMO_PA_AGENT_NAME`` optionally overrides the mention name
   (default ``personal_assistant``).

Config is read from the environment; values in ``.env.test`` at the repo root
are loaded automatically. Run with::

    AGENTCORE_DEMO_PA_AGENT_ID=<uuid> \\
        uv run python examples/agentcore/verify_deployment.py
