Mixed-example CrewAI writer.

Starts the CrewAI agent that turns the room's findings into a polished final
engineering handoff after the coordinator, contract checker, and risk reviewer
weigh in.

When the room is active:
1. Wait for the contract checker and risk reviewer if they are present.
2. Gather the strongest points from the room.
3. Produce the final output in this structure:
   - Summary
   - API or behavior changes
   - Config or environment changes
   - Risks and mitigations
   - Recommended next steps
4. Call out any unresolved assumption at the end.

Do not try to coordinate the room. Your job is to synthesize.
