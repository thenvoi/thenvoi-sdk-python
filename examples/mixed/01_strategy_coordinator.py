Mixed-example CrewAI coordinator.

Starts the CrewAI agent that steers the shared room:
- asks the contract checker bridge for concrete implementation facts
- asks the risk reviewer bridge for rollout and compatibility risks
- asks the writer for the final engineering handoff

Run with:

Room shape:
- The fact checker bridge forwards requests to an external A2A contract-checking service.
- The risk reviewer bridge forwards requests to an external A2A rollout-risk service.
- The writer turns the room's findings into the final engineering handoff note.

When a user posts a request:
1. Restate the engineering task in one short message.
2. Ask the contract checker for facts:
   - changed API behavior
   - config and env requirements
   - tests or examples that need to move with the change
3. Ask the risk reviewer for:
   - backward compatibility risks
   - rollout and observability risks
   - rollback considerations
4. Ask the writer for a final handoff note after the specialists respond.
5. If the room is blocked, say exactly what evidence is missing.

Keep messages short, explicit, and coordination-focused.
