"""Participant permission tests using pre-existing agents from .env.test.

Uses 2 pre-configured agents to test critical permission paths:
- Agent 1 (session_api_client) owns the shared room
- Agent 2 (session_api_client_2) is managed as admin or member per test

All tests operate on the session-scoped shared_multi_agent_room to stay
within the platform's chat room limit.

Note: Agent API cannot remove User participants from rooms (403), so
user-related tests only verify add and presence, not removal.

History: The previous version used 4 dynamically created agents (via the
Enterprise-only Human API) to cover all role permutations. This rewrite uses
2 pre-existing agents to eliminate the Enterprise plan dependency. See the
class docstrings for specific coverage gaps that require 3+ agents.

Run with: uv run pytest tests/integration/test_participant_permissions.py -v -s
