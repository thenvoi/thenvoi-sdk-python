"""E2E tests for room isolation.

Tests that agents in different rooms don't see each other's context.
Each room maintains independent conversation history.

This verifies:
- Per-room state management in adapters
- Platform correctly scopes /context to individual rooms
- No cross-room leakage of conversation data

Run with:
    E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true uv run pytest tests/e2e/scenarios/test_room_isolation.py -v -s --no-cov
