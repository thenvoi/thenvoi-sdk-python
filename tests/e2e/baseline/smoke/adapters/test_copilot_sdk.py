"""Copilot SDK showcase smokes — the toolkit driving the Copilot adapter live.

Copilot SDK is a ``core``-lane matrix adapter gated only on the Anthropic BYOK
key (the singular provider replaces Copilot-hosted inference, so GitHub auth is
not required; see ``toolkit/builders.py``). The generic matrix (``smoke/matrix/``)
already runs the standard scenarios against it via the registry builder. These
are Copilot-focused instead: ``ask_user`` routing (handler and room mode), recall
when Copilot's *native* session resume misses, and one client shared across adapter
lifecycles — none of which the generic builder's ``prompt``/``features``/``tools``
contract can express, so each test constructs ``CopilotSDKAdapter`` by hand (like
``test_parlant.py``) and hands it to the toolkit's run primitives.

Because construction is bespoke, these expose no adapter binding to the lane
selector (no ``@with_adapters``/``@per_adapter`` — that would demand the ``agent``
fixture and re-provision generically). So gating stays explicit (``@requires``) and
lane scoping is pinned with ``@lane(Lane.CORE)`` — without it the selector would see
no framework and run these heavy smokes in *every* lane.
