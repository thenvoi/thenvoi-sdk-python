"""Matrix scenario: a partial reboot in a live two-agent room.

Where ``test_context_recall.test_recalls_after_rejoin`` reboots the *only* agent in
a solo room, this scenario proves the same rehydration guarantee holds under a
harder, more realistic shape: two agents share a room, and we reboot exactly *one*
of them while the *other stays running* the whole time. Two properties fall out
that the single-agent rejoin test cannot exercise:

* Selective/partial rehydration — the rebooted agent (a fresh adapter under the
  same identity, no in-memory state) still recalls a fact stated before its reboot,
  which can only have come from the platform rehydrating the room on bootstrap
  (``/context``). The reboot happens amid a live peer, not in an empty room.
* Peer continuity — the never-rebooted agent, which stayed up across its neighbour's
  churn, answers a liveness probe unperturbed. Rebooting one participant does not
  disturb the other.

The two agents are *distinct identities* built from the same adapter cell (two
``cell.provision`` calls with distinct labels), so the stayer running across both
of the rebooter's runs is fine — only overlapping runs of *one* identity are
guarded. The rebooter's two runs are strictly sequential (the inner run context
fully exits before it is re-entered), which is what ``track_running`` requires.

Both agents share one capture buffer, so each assertion is scoped to the sender it
is about — the recall to the ``rebooter`` (it, not the never-rebooted stayer, must
be the one that rehydrated) and the liveness reply to the ``stayer`` (it, not the
rebooter, must be the one that stayed responsive).

Excludes ``codex`` / ``opencode``: those adapters recover context on reboot by
resuming their own backend session (a session id persisted via task events), not by
consuming platform ``/context`` as history — a different mechanism, so a pass there
would not validate the ``/context`` rehydration this scenario asserts.

Also excludes ``langgraph``: observed live, its rebooted agent processes the recall
turn but emits *no* chat reply when a second agent shares the room (it passes the
solo ``test_recalls_after_rejoin`` / offline cold-boot cases, so ``/context``
rehydration itself works — the gap is specific to replying after a reboot in a
live multi-agent room). Tracked as a langgraph-adapter behaviour to investigate;
excluded here so the scenario stays green for the adapters that support it.

``letta`` was previously excluded here for a different reason, confirmed live: the
self-hosted Letta adapter registered its Band MCP tool server per instance, but
Letta stored MCP tools by name at organization scope and re-pointed the shared
``band_send_message`` row to whichever instance registered most recently. With two
Letta agents live in one org, the rebooted agent *did* answer, but its send routed
through the peer's MCP server and posted under the peer's identity, so the
stayer-scoped reply was never observed. This was fixed by provisioning each
adapter instance its own Letta organization/user, so ``letta`` now runs this
scenario like every other adapter.

Wording note: a neutral "note", not a "secret code" (models refuse to echo a
credential-shaped value — an unrelated false failure).
