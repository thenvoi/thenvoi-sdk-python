"""Multi-agent collaboration smokes: a room of *different framework types* doing
different things together.

Three scenarios, each a single shared room with a heterogeneous cast built from
the registry's tool-capable, ``core``-lane adapters (anthropic + pydantic_ai +
agno) so they all install in one venv and the run is lane-schedulable:

* ``test_coordinator_delegates_to_two_specialists`` — a coordinator fans a
  compound request out to two specialists (one per framework), each runs its own
  tool, and the coordinator synthesizes both opaque results.
* ``test_coordinator_recruits_specialist_mid_conversation`` — a room that starts
  with the coordinator alone; it uses ``band_add_participant`` to recruit a
  specialist mid-conversation, which then runs the tool the coordinator can't.
* ``test_heterogeneous_agents_triage_concurrent_mentions`` — three framework
  types in one room, hit with concurrent mentions, each handling only its own.
* ``test_coordinator_delegates_via_task_board`` — a coordinator hands off a
  sprint through the room's task board instead of chat: it creates one task per
  specialist, and each specialist claims, works, and completes its task via
  ``band_update_task`` -- no chat reply from either specialist.

Design notes (why this shape, not a bespoke build):

- **One uniform prompt, roles via the user message.** ``@with_adapters`` builds
  every agent with the same prompt/tools, so the *role* (coordinator vs.
  specialist) is set by the runtime-injected user message — exactly how the
  greeting smoke injects peer names. This keeps the test on the lane-safe
  decorator path (gated, provisioned, reaped, and ``BAND_E2E_LANE``-scoped) that a
  bespoke ``build_adapter`` call would bypass.
- **Delegation integrity comes from sender-scoped tool reads, not tool absence.**
  Every agent carries both tools, so the coordinator *could* answer alone; we
  prove it didn't by asserting the *specialist's own* ``tool_call`` events fired
  (``tool_calls(sender_id=specialist)``). The values are opaque (a secret code, a
  fictional forecast) — they can only reach the room if the specialist actually
  ran its tool.
- **Cascade barrier via ``wait_until``.** A coordinator→specialists→coordinator
  cascade spans several turns, so a single ``wait_for_processed`` won't cover it;
  we barrier on the opaque results appearing in the room (the only race-free
  "the cascade finished" signal that needs no live tool subscription). The
  concurrent-triage test has no cascade, so it uses the per-mention delivery
  barrier.
