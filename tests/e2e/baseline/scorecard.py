"""The adapter×test scorecard: pass / fail / skip / N-A (+ reason) in one artifact.

Excluded adapters produce no test node (``specs()`` omits them), so a matrix cell an
adapter opts out of would otherwise vanish from the results with its reason buried in a
code comment. This module makes the full grid observable:

* :func:`na_rows` reads each ``@per_adapter`` marker's ``exclude`` records (the reasons
  live on the marker — see ``agents.PerAdapter``) and emits an ``N/A`` row per excluded
  cell, so no cell disappears without a trace.
* :class:`ScorecardCollector` records the run outcome (pass / fail / skip) of every
  collected cell from its test report — exact ``nodeid`` keys, no junit-name scraping.
* :func:`merge` unions the per-lane scorecards CI emits (each lane runs only its own
  cells; the rest are ``skip``) into one grid.
* :func:`gate` turns a merged grid into a pass/fail verdict for CI: any ``fail`` cell,
  or any ``skip`` cell whose expected lane (its ``@lane`` pin, or else its adapter's
  home lane) was expected to run this invocation, reddens it.

The pieces are pure functions so they unit-test without a live platform; the conftest is
a thin hook delegate, and ``python -m tests.e2e.baseline.scorecard merge`` is the
post-run CI step that folds the lanes together and gates on the result.
