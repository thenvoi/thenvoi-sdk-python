"""Dynamic provisioning (provision/reap) for live E2E tests.

Provisions fresh platform resources per run so tests never depend on a static,
pre-configured agent: register an agent (getting its own credentials), create
rooms, and force-delete everything on teardown. A prefix-guarded orphan sweep
reaps leftovers from crashed prior runs.

Provisioned agents are named ``e2e-band-{run_id}-{label}`` so the sweep can
recognise its own resources by prefix and never touch a non-test agent.
