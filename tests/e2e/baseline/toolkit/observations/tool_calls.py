"""Tool-observation capture and assertions for live E2E tests.

Captures the agent-under-test's tool calls for a turn: which tools fired, with
which arguments. When an adapter runs with execution reporting on
(``Emit.TOOL_CALLS``), each tool invocation is recorded as a ``tool_call`` event
whose ``content`` is JSON ``{"name", "args", "tool_call_id"}``. Those events are
persisted and read back via the Human messages API (``UserOps.list_messages``).

This reads the durable record *after* the turn completes (pair it with the
delivery-status barrier ``wait_for_processed``), so it needs no live event
subscription. The read is race-free by a specific contract, worth stating
because the barrier is a *delivery-state* signal while this reads *events* via a
different path (the messages-list API filtered to ``tool_call``): the adapter
``await``s each tool-call event POST before it ever emits its reply, and the
platform only marks a message ``processed`` *after* that reply is emitted — so
once ``wait_for_processed`` returns, every tool-call event of that turn is
already persisted and queryable. A real-time path would instead need to buffer
the chat-room WebSocket notifications for non-text rows; reading the persisted
events is simpler and sufficient for asserting what fired.

Tests reach this through ``ReplyCapture.tool_calls`` (see ``capture.py``), which
returns a :class:`ToolCalls` carrying the calls plus a fluent ``assert_fired``.
