"""Event-driven wait primitives for live E2E tests.

Deterministic, not timing-based. Completion is detected from the platform's own
delivery-status signal, never from a silence window. ``deadline_s`` is a
*failure* deadline: it bounds how long we wait before declaring the agent stuck,
and is never used as a success signal.

The surface is small — methods on ``ReplyCapture``:

- ``wait_until`` — the engine: block until a predicate over captured state holds,
  or raise ``TimeoutError`` at the deadline. Use directly for a custom condition.
- ``wait_for_delivery`` — block until a recipient's delivery status for a message
  reaches one of the given ``DeliveryStatus`` values; the general delivery waiter.
- ``wait_for_processed`` — the common barrier built on ``wait_for_delivery``:
  block until a recipient has *processed* a given message. Use it before reading
  *durable* turn state (memory, tool calls, usage, events) — persisted by the time a
  message is processed.
- ``wait_for_reply`` — the reply barrier: block until the turn is processed *and* the
  agent's reply frame has actually been captured. Use it (not ``wait_for_processed``)
  before asserting on captured reply text — the reply's ``message_created`` frame and
  the delivery-status ``message_updated`` frame are independent, unordered platform
  events, so the buffer can lag the processed signal.
- ``delivery_status`` / ``delivery_history`` — inspect the current state and the
  observed transition sequence (e.g. ``[PROCESSING, PROCESSED]``).

Why this is enough: the room processes a room's messages strictly one-at-a-time
in FIFO order (a single per-room process loop), and the agent marks a message
``processed`` when its handler completes. So waiting for the last message you sent
to be processed (its id is returned by ``send_message``) proves every earlier
message was handled — no probe message and no reply-text matching required. Note:
``processed`` does **not** imply a reply was emitted — replies are optional (the LLM
may not call ``band_send_message``), so never infer reply presence from the barrier.

        ``reply_capture`` fixture); the agent must run with ``Emit.TOOL_CALLS`` for
        the call layer to be populated.
