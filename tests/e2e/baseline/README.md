# Baseline E2E Toolkit

Reusable building blocks for live end-to-end tests that drive real agents against
a real Band platform.

**Coding agents: read "Writing a test" and "Rules" first, then reuse the fixtures
and helpers here — do not rebuild provisioning, waiting, adapter construction, or
assertions.** A baseline test should contain the *scenario*, never the plumbing.
These tools validate platform behaviour and integration, not LLM output quality;
they are deterministic by design (no `sleep`, no silence windows).

**Search before you build — do not reinvent the wheel.** Before writing a new
test, helper, tool, prompt, or assertion, grep the existing suite for one that
already does it (or nearly does):

- **A scenario like yours may already exist.** `grep -rl` the `smoke/` tree for
  the behaviour; if a test covers it for one adapter or a hardcoded subset,
  *parametrize/extend it* (or flip a registry selector — `runs_tool_loop=True`,
  `supports={Capability.MEMORY}`) instead of adding a parallel test. A matrix test
  supersedes a hardcoded-list one; delete what it subsumes rather than stacking.
- **Custom tools / driving instructions already exist** in
  `smoke/samples/sample_tools.py` (`LOOKUP_TOOL`, `WEATHER_TOOL`, `EXECUTION_REPORTING`)
  and `smoke/samples/sample_agents.py` (`store_memory_instruction`,
  `recall_memory_instruction`, `emit_event_instruction`, the `**TOOL_AGENT` /
  `**MEMORY_AGENT` shapes). Reuse a `ToolSpec`/instruction; add one there (not
  inline, not a duplicate) only if none fits.
- **Assertions live on the observation collections** (`Replies`, `Events`,
  `ToolCalls`, `Memories`) — reach for `assert_contains_any` / `assert_contains_none`
  / `assert_fired` / `assert_stored` before writing a raw `assert`. Add a method
  there only if it's a genuinely new, reusable check.
- **Never hardcode an adapter list.** Use the `Adapter` enum with `@with_adapters`,
  or a registry selector with `@per_adapter` — the matrix follows the registry.

When you do add something reusable, put it in the shared module (a `ToolSpec` in
`sample_tools`, an instruction in `sample_agents`, an assertion on the collection)
so the next agent finds and reuses it instead of writing a third copy.

Run: `E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true uv run pytest tests/e2e/baseline/ -v -s --no-cov`

**Wiring a new framework adapter into the matrix?** See
[`ADDING_AN_ADAPTER.md`](ADDING_AN_ADAPTER.md) — the step-by-step howto for
registering an adapter so every matrix scenario runs against it for free.

## Writing a test

Every baseline test is the same shape: get a running agent, open a capture, send a
user message, barrier on it, assert. The toolkit supplies all of it.

```python notest
@with_adapters(Adapter.ANTHROPIC)                  # 1. agent: built + gated + run + reaped
@pytest.mark.asyncio(loop_scope="session")
async def test_greets(agent, resource_manager, user_ops, reply_capture):
    room_id = await resource_manager.provision_room(participants=[agent.id])   # 2. room
    async with reply_capture(room_id) as capture:                             # 3. capture
        mid = await user_ops.send_message(                                    # 4. drive as user
            room_id, "say hi", mention_id=agent.id, mention_name=agent.name
        )
        replies = await capture.wait_for_reply(mid, agent.id)                 # 5. reply barrier
    replies.assert_present()                                                  # 6. assert on what it returns
```

`@with_adapters` / `@per_adapter` auto-apply the `@requires` provider-key gate
from the registry, and the agent/room are reaped on teardown — so the body has no
gate, no construction, no lifecycle, no cleanup.

Every test declares its topology **on the test**, with one of two decorators:

- **`@per_adapter(...)`** *fans* — one invocation per selected adapter. Bare
  `@per_adapter()` is the full matrix, explicitly. Request `agent` (a managed,
  running `ProvisionedAgent`; its id is `agent.adapter_id`) or `cell` (an
  `AdapterCell` you drive yourself, for construction / reboot / rehydration).
- **`@with_adapters(...)`** *groups* — a fixed set of named adapters in one room, one
  invocation. Request `agent` (the single case) or `agents` (the list).

A matrix test **must** carry `@per_adapter` — there is no "bare fixture = full
matrix" path. Requesting an agent fixture with the wrong (or no) decorator is a
collection-time error (see **Wiring fences** below).

### `@per_adapter` vs `@with_adapters` — the two roles

They are **not** two ways to do one thing; they are different *topologies*. You pass
`Adapter` handles to both (hence both read as `*_adapters`), but the axis differs:

| | `@per_adapter` (fan) | `@with_adapters` (group) |
|---|---|---|
| **Runs** | once **per** selected adapter (parametrized) | **once**, all adapters together |
| **Agents per run** | one (`agent`), or a `cell` you drive | many, in one room (`agents`) |
| **Select by** | *filters* — `supports=`, `exclude=`, "every memory adapter" | *explicit ids* — you name the room's participants |
| **CI lanes** | lane-safe (each cell runs in its home lane); a `peer=` folds a second framework in | can span lanes → the schedulability guard catches an unschedulable span |
| **Use for** | "run this scenario across frameworks" | "these specific agents interact" |

You cannot express a multi-agent-in-one-room test with `@per_adapter` (it fans them into
separate runs), nor "across the whole matrix" with `@with_adapters` (a fixed list, one
room). What they *share* — `@requires` gating, `AdapterCell` construction, and
`prompt`/`features`/`tools` steering — is reused, not duplicated.

### Choosing how to get your agent(s)

| Your test needs… | Use | Inject |
|---|---|---|
| one named adapter | `@with_adapters(Adapter.ANTHROPIC)` | `agent` — a `ProvisionedAgent` |
| several named adapters in one room | `@with_adapters(Adapter.LANGGRAPH, Adapter.ANTHROPIC)` | `agents` — list; `a, b = agents` |
| two of the **same** adapter | `@with_adapters(Adapter.ANTHROPIC, Adapter.ANTHROPIC)` | `agents` |
| the **same scenario across every adapter** | `@per_adapter()` (the full matrix, explicitly) | `agent` (id via `agent.adapter_id`) |
| a **subset** of adapters | `@per_adapter(Adapter.X, Adapter.Y)` (positional = include) / `@per_adapter(exclude=[ExcludedAdapter(Adapter.X, "reason")] / supports={Capability.MEMORY} / without={Capability.MEMORY} / runs_tool_loop=True)` | `agent` |
| to **drive the lifecycle yourself** (build-only, reboot, rehydration) | `@per_adapter()` | `cell` — an `AdapterCell` (see **AdapterCell** below) |
| a **fanned cell A + one different-framework peer B** (cross-framework) | `@per_adapter(exclude=[ExcludedAdapter(Adapter.X, "it is the peer")], peer=Adapter.X)` | `cell` (A) + `peer` (B, an `AdapterCell` you drive); peer deps fold into the cell's `@requires` |
| custom tools (any tool-capable framework) | `@with_adapters(Adapter.X, tools=[LOOKUP_TOOL], **EXECUTION_REPORTING)` — one `ToolSpec`, translated per framework (anthropic-family, pydantic-ai, agno) | `agent` |
| custom tools across the matrix | `@per_adapter(Adapter.ANTHROPIC, Adapter.PYDANTIC_AI, Adapter.AGNO, tools=[LOOKUP_TOOL], **EXECUTION_REPORTING)` | `agent` |

- **Reference adapters by the typed `Adapter` enum, never a string.**
- **Steer construction with a shape, don't re-spell args:** `@with_adapters(Adapter.X, **TOOL_AGENT)`
  (exact-tool-execution prompt) or `**MEMORY_AGENT` (that prompt + memory tools
  surfaced as `tool_call` events). `@per_adapter(..., **MEMORY_AGENT)` works too —
  the steering (`prompt` / `features` / `tools`) rides on the decorator and is
  carried per-cell as the `agent` / `cell` defaults.
- `agent` is the cell's (or slot's) running `ProvisionedAgent`; read its id off
  `agent.adapter_id` (no separate `adapter_id` fixture to request, no unpacking).
- **Custom tools:** define a tool once as a `ToolSpec` (input model + handler) and
  pass `tools=[LOOKUP_TOOL]` to `@with_adapters` / `@per_adapter`; the builders
  translate it to each framework's native form (band `CustomToolDef`, a pydantic-ai
  `RunContext` callable, an agno tool). Add `**EXECUTION_REPORTING` to observe the
  calls via `capture.tool_calls`. Only letta can't accept a local tool (MCP) and
  **rejects** `tools` with a clear error rather than silently dropping it.
- **Cross-framework peer:** `@per_adapter(exclude=[ExcludedAdapter(Adapter.X, "reason")], peer=Adapter.X)` fans A
  across the matrix and hands each cell a *different-framework* peer B via the `peer`
  fixture (an `AdapterCell` the test drives — provision + `run_as`). The peer's
  `@requires` fold into the cell's single gate mark, and the peer is visible to lane
  scheduling (so A + B must be lane-hostable together — see **CI lanes** below).
  `@per_adapter` rejects a peer that is not a **live** (non-`e2e_pending`) adapter, and
  the `peer` fixture fails loud if the peer equals the cell (same framework, not cross).
  Worked example: `smoke/matrix/test_rehydration_cross_framework.py`.

### Driving and observing a turn

- **Send as the user:** `mid = await user_ops.send_message(room_id, text, mention_id=, mention_name=)`.
- **Two barriers — pick by what you assert:**
  - `replies = await capture.wait_for_reply(mid, agent.id[, since=])` — use
    this whenever you then assert on **reply text** (`assert_present`,
    `assert_contains_any`, `mentioning`, …). It waits until the turn is processed **and**
    the reply frame is actually captured, and returns that reply window to assert on.
  - `await capture.wait_for_processed(mid, agent.id)` — use this when you read **durable**
    turn state (`tool_calls`/`usage`/`events`/`memory`) or just need the turn done. A
    reply is *optional* here.
  - ⚠️ Why two: the reply's `message_created` frame and the delivery-status
    `message_updated`→PROCESSED frame are **independent, unordered** platform events, so
    PROCESSED does **not** imply the reply is buffered yet. Asserting on `capture.messages`
    right after `wait_for_processed` is a race ("no agent messages were captured"). Assert
    on what `wait_for_reply` **returns**, not by re-reading `capture.messages`.
- **Reused capture, later turn:** `mark = capture.messages.snapshot()` before sending,
  then pass `since=mark` to `wait_for_reply` (or `capture.messages.since(mark)` after a
  `wait_for_processed` durable read).
- **Inspect (read-after-barrier):** `capture.tool_calls()`, `capture.thoughts()/errors()/tasks()`,
  `capture.memory(agent)` — see the inspection sections below.

## Rules (clean, lean, reuse — no reinvention)

**Do**
- Reuse the fixtures for everything — provisioning, the user driver, capture, waits,
  assertions. Your test is the scenario, not the scaffolding.
- Wait event-driven: `wait_for_reply` (asserting on reply text) / `wait_for_processed`
  (durable-state reads) / `wait_for_delivery` / `wait_until`.
- Assert cheaply and tolerantly: the `Replies`/`Events`/`Memories` assertion
  methods first; the `judge` only for genuinely semantic outcomes.
- Use the `Adapter` enum, the `**TOOL_AGENT` / `**MEMORY_AGENT` shapes, and
  `capture.messages.snapshot()` / `.since()`.
- Add a new adapter to the matrix with one `@adapter` builder + one `Adapter` member
  (the discovery guard fails loudly until both exist).

**Don't**
- ❌ `time.sleep` / `asyncio.sleep` / fixed silence windows — flaky; use the waiters.
- ❌ hand-rolled provisioning/reaping, raw REST/WS clients, or hand-built adapters
  where a fixture or registry builder exists.
- ❌ `len(capture.messages)` + slice — use `snapshot()` / `since()`.
- ❌ magic-string adapter ids — use `Adapter.X`.
- ❌ a separate `@requires` when `@with_adapters` / `@per_adapter` already gate it.
- ❌ a hand-rolled `@pytest.mark.parametrize("adapter_id", …)` matrix — use
  `@per_adapter` (the wiring guard blocks the hand-rolled form).
- ❌ exact-count / strict-ordering / mandatory-silence / literal-transcript
  assertions — agents are non-deterministic; assert *behaviour held* (a floor, a
  substring, a metadata fact, the injected marker).
- ❌ the `judge` by reflex — it costs tokens and is itself non-deterministic; use it
  only when no structural check can express the outcome.
- ❌ skipping on missing config — a missing key/CLI/server **fails** with the reason
  (see Validation policy). Only `E2E_TESTS_ENABLED` skips.

## Design values: consistency, simplicity, ease

These three are why the toolkit is shaped the way it is — keep them when extending it.

- **Consistency** — one way to do each thing, applied uniformly. Agents come from
  `@with_adapters` / `@per_adapter`; waits go through the delivery barrier;
  assertions are tolerant. The same rule holds everywhere: **fail loudly with a
  reason, never silently** — a missing key/CLI/server fails (never skips), an
  unregistered adapter fails the discovery guard, and an adapter that can't honor
  `tools` rejects rather than dropping them. No special cases a reader has to memorize.
- **Single source of truth** — each fact lives in exactly one place and is referenced,
  never re-spelled: adapter ids are the typed `Adapter` enum (no magic strings —
  `include`/`exclude` take `Adapter` members), a custom tool is one `ToolSpec`, and
  prompt/feature bundles are shapes (`**TOOL_AGENT` / `**MEMORY_AGENT` /
  `**EXECUTION_REPORTING`). Change the fact once; every test follows.
- **Simplicity** — the test is the *scenario*, not the scaffolding. Provisioning,
  gating, running, reaping, and cleanup live in fixtures/decorators, so a test body
  is just "send this, expect that". If a test grows plumbing, the plumbing belongs in
  the toolkit.
- **Ease of use** — the common path is the short path: a decorator + a fixture, typed
  `Adapter` handles (no magic strings), reusable shapes (`**TOOL_AGENT` /
  `**MEMORY_AGENT` / `**EXECUTION_REPORTING`) instead of re-spelled args, and
  `messages.snapshot()/since()` instead of manual indexing. A coding agent should be
  able to write a correct test from the table above without inventing anything.

## Layout: what is where

| Path | What it is |
|------|------------|
| `toolkit/provisioning.py` | `ResourceManager` (provision/reap agents + rooms, orphan sweep, `track_running` reboot-race guard; `.peer(agent)` mints a `PeerActor`), `AdapterCell` (build / provision / running / run_as — the per-cell lifecycle object behind `agent`/`cell`), `running_agent` (run an already-provisioned identity — enter twice against one identity for a rejoin), `running_provisioned_agent` (provision + run, composes `running_agent`), `ProvisionedAgent` (`.adapter_id` records the cell/slot it came from), `PeerActor` (act as a peer agent — post one message as that agent via its own key; the Agent-API twin of `UserOps`, used for the L0/L4 `Echo` peer) |
| `tests/baseline/adapter.py` | shared `Adapter` enum and adapter discovery — the one source of adapter ids for offline and E2E baseline suites |
| `toolkit/adapters.py` | E2E registry core: the `@adapter` decorator + registry, `spec_for`, `build_adapter`, `specs`, `adapter_lane`, and the registry/discovery guard |
| `toolkit/builders.py` | the per-framework `@adapter` builder functions (one `_build_*` each); imported by `adapters.py` for the registration side-effect — no public API. Add a new adapter's builder here (see `ADDING_AN_ADAPTER.md`) |
| `toolkit/ci_lanes.py` | the CI-lane partition + workflow-drift guards: `CILane`, `ci_lanes`, `hosting_lanes` (which lanes' `uv` extra can host a framework), `assert_every_adapter_has_a_ci_home`, `assert_workflow_lane_*` |
| `toolkit/tools.py` | `ToolSpec` — define a custom tool **once** (input model + handler); the builders translate it to each framework's native form |
| `agents.py` | topology decorators: `@with_adapters(Adapter.X, ...)` (fixed set / one room → `agent`/`agents`), `@per_adapter(*adapters, exclude/supports/without/runs_tool_loop, prompt=, features=, tools=)` (fan across the matrix/subset → `agent`/`cell`); `adapter_params` is the internal parameter source `@per_adapter` feeds to the `adapter_id` fixture |
| `smoke/samples/sample_agents.py` | shared driving glue: the role-setting `TOOL_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, `memory_features()`, reusable **agent shapes** (`TOOL_AGENT`, `MEMORY_AGENT`) for `@with_adapters(..., **SHAPE)` / `@per_adapter(..., **SHAPE)`, and the `*_instruction(...)` builders |
| `fixtures/agents.py` | the agent fixtures: `agent` (single running `ProvisionedAgent`), `agents` (the `@with_adapters` group), `cell` (an `AdapterCell` to drive yourself), `adapter_id` (internal `@per_adapter` parametrize target) |
| `agent_wiring.py` | `assert_agent_fixtures_wired` — the collection-time guard that rejects mis-wired decorator/fixture pairings (see **Wiring fences**) |
| `smoke/samples/sample_tools.py` | sample custom tools as `ToolSpec`s (`LOOKUP_TOOL`, `WEATHER_TOOL`), prompts, and the `EXECUTION_REPORTING` shape |
| `toolkit/user_ops.py` | `UserOps`: act as the test user (send message, create/delete room, add/remove/list participants, list messages/events, `lookup_peers` — the invitable roster) |
| `toolkit/capture.py` | `ReplyCapture` (subscribe-before-send), `reply_capture` ctx, `wait_for_reply` (reply barrier), `wait_for_processed` (delivery-status barrier), `tool_calls()`/`thoughts()`/`errors()`/`tasks()`/`events()`/`memory(agent)`, `CaptureFactory` |
| `toolkit/deps.py` | pytest-free requirement facts: `Dep` enum, `DepSpec` predicates, `Lane`/`LANE_EXTRAS`, `dep_lane` (the **one** source of the `Dep`/lane facts the registry references without importing pytest) |
| `toolkit/judge.py` | `judge()` LLM-as-judge, `Verdict`, `format_transcript` |
| `toolkit/observations/` | list subclasses that own their assertions: `Replies` (replies; `snapshot()`/`since()`, `mentioning(id)` to filter to replies mentioning a participant, `assert_contains_any`/`assert_mentions`), `ToolCalls`/`ToolCall` + `MemoryToolCalls`, `Events`→`Thoughts`/`Errors`/`Tasks`, `Memories`/`MemoryObservation`; shared `tolerant_match` + `ContentAssertions` |
| `settings.py` | `BaselineSettings`: endpoints, credentials, run policy, LLM creds + models |
| `requires.py` | `@requires(Dep.X)` decorator (the pytest glue; re-exports `Dep` from `toolkit/deps.py`, where the enum and its facts actually live) |
| `timeouts.py` | `slow_turn_budget(e2e_timeout, barriers=N)` → the paired `deadline_s` (per barrier) + `extra_s` (`@pytest.mark.timeout(extra=)`) for a test awaiting N sequential slow-backend turns, so the soft barrier always fires before the hard backstop |
| `conftest.py` | fixtures (below) + the always-on E2E gate |
| `guards/` | E2E-tree harness self-tests (E2E-gated): `test_adapter_registry.py` (static discovery/lane guard), `test_provisioning.py`, `test_user_ops.py`, `test_adapter_cell.py`, `test_tool_spec.py`, and `test_agent_wiring.py` (only the `pytester` real-collection cases). **Pure policy tests run every PR from `tests/framework_conformance/`** — see the note below the table |
| `smoke/` | proof tests that exercise the tools end to end — read these as worked examples — grouped by subject (below) |
| `smoke/samples/` | shared driving glue (not tests): `sample_agents.py`, `sample_tools.py` |
| `smoke/matrix/` | runs across the adapter matrix: `test_adapter_matrix.py`, `test_capability_matrix.py` (memory store + recall), `test_context_recall.py` (in-session + rejoin), `test_rehydration_offline.py` / `test_rehydration_partial.py` (cold-boot / partial-reboot `/context` recall), `test_rehydration_cross_framework.py` (a different-framework `peer=` authors, A rehydrates), `test_room_isolation.py`, `test_noisy_room.py`, `test_tool_round_trip.py` (custom-tool subgroup) |
| `smoke/behavior/` | platform/transport + scenario behavior: `test_delivery_status.py`, `test_processing_barrier.py`, `test_isolation.py`, `test_agent_scenarios.py` |
| `smoke/inspection/` | `capture.*` observation worked-examples: `test_tool_calls.py`, `test_events.py`, `test_memory.py`, `test_usage.py` (the `Emit.USAGE` fan), plus `test_next_actionable_semantics.py` (a platform `/next` invariant, `@lane`-pinned since it runs no adapter) |
| `smoke/adapters/` | adapter-specific showcases: `test_a2a.py`, `test_a2a_gateway.py`, `test_a2a_roundtrip.py` (+ their shared `a2aServer.py` fixture -- a scripted, non-Band A2A counterparty), `test_agno.py`, `test_copilot_acp.py`, `test_copilot_sdk.py`, `test_crewai.py`, `test_letta.py`, `test_opencode.py`, `test_parlant.py` |

The `toolkit/` modules are pytest-free and reusable anywhere. The package root
(`settings`, `requires`, `agents`, `conftest`) is the pytest wiring.

**Pure policy tests run on every PR — put them outside this tree.** The whole
`tests/e2e/**` tree is skipped unless `E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true` (which PR CI does not
set), so a pure-logic guard placed here protects nothing on PRs. The collection-time
policy tests therefore live in **`tests/framework_conformance/`** (no platform, no
keys, run every PR): `test_lane_scheduling.py` (the derive-then-guard scheduling +
`hosting_lanes` rules), `test_e2e_lane_drift.py` (the `@lane`/workflow drift guards),
and `test_agent_wiring_rules.py` (the `assert_agent_fixtures_wired` policy). When you
add a new pure guard/policy check, put its unit tests there; keep only
fixture-closure / platform-touching cases under `guards/`.

## Fixtures (from `conftest.py`)

`baseline_settings`, `user_ops`, `resource_manager`, `reply_capture`, `judge`,
`agent`, `agents`, `cell`, `adapter_id`, `baseline_ws`.

- `reply_capture` and `judge` pre-bind their plumbing (the WS observer; the judge
  model + key), so tests pass only the test-specific arguments.
- `agent` is the single running `ProvisionedAgent` — sourced from `@per_adapter`
  (the current cell) **or** `@with_adapters(OneAdapter)`. Its id is `agent.adapter_id`.
- `agents` is the running group declared by `@with_adapters(A, B, …)`, in declared
  order; each carries its own `.adapter_id`.
- `cell` is the `@per_adapter` cell's `AdapterCell` — request it (instead of `agent`)
  when the test drives its own lifecycle (a build-only check, or a reboot /
  rehydration scenario). See **AdapterCell** below.
- All three build/provision/run through the registry and are reaped on teardown; the
  decorator also auto-applies the requirement gate.
- The old per-cell agent fixture is **gone**, and so is the old "bare fixture
  request = full matrix" path — a full-matrix test is now written `@per_adapter()`
  and reads `agent` / `agent.adapter_id`.
- `adapter_id` is the internal parametrize target `@per_adapter` fans over; it is
  normalized to `str`. Live tests read `agent.adapter_id`, manual tests
  `cell.adapter_id` — you rarely request `adapter_id` directly.
- The E2E + Band-key gate is applied to every baseline test automatically, so a
  gate-only test needs no decorator.

## AdapterCell: driving the lifecycle yourself

Under `@per_adapter()`, request **`cell`** (an `AdapterCell`) instead of `agent`
when the test owns the agent's start/stop — a no-provision construction check, or a
reboot / restart / rehydration scenario. `agent` is just sugar over `cell.running()`;
the decorator's `prompt` / `features` / `tools` steering is carried on the cell as
defaults (a method argument overrides).

| Method | Does | Provisions? | Runs? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cell.build()` | constructs the adapter without running it | no | no |
| `await cell.provision(label=…)` | registers a tracked+reaped identity (`ProvisionedAgent`) | yes | no |
| `async with cell.run_as(identity)` | runs a *fresh* adapter under an existing identity | no | yes |
| `async with cell.running(label=…)` | provision **and** run in one step (what `agent` uses) | yes | yes |

Build-only (cheap, sync test):

```python notest
@per_adapter()
def test_build(cell):
    assert isinstance(cell.build(), SimpleAdapter)   # no network, no provisioning
```

Reboot / rehydration — provision once, enter `run_as` **twice** (stop → fresh run
under the same identity), so a correct recall in run 2 can only have come from the
platform rehydrating the room, not in-memory adapter state:

```python notest
@per_adapter(prompt=REPLY_PROMPT)
async def test_recalls_after_rejoin(cell, resource_manager, user_ops, reply_capture):
    identity = await cell.provision(f"rejoin-{cell.adapter_id}")
    room_id = await resource_manager.provision_room(participants=[identity.id])

    async with cell.run_as(identity):          # run 1: state a note, then stop
        async with reply_capture(room_id) as capture:
            mid = await user_ops.send_message(room_id, REMEMBER, mention_id=identity.id, mention_name=identity.name)
            await capture.wait_for_processed(mid, identity.id)

    async with cell.run_as(identity):          # run 2: fresh adapter, same identity
        async with reply_capture(room_id) as capture:
            mark = capture.messages.snapshot()
            mid = await user_ops.send_message(room_id, RECALL, mention_id=identity.id, mention_name=identity.name)
            replies = await capture.wait_for_reply(mid, identity.id, since=mark)
            replies.assert_contains_any([note])
```

Cross-framework peer — fan cell **A** across the matrix and drive a *different-framework*
peer **B** (via the `peer` fixture) in the same room; `.mentioning()` filters a capture
to replies that mention a participant. See `smoke/matrix/test_rehydration_cross_framework.py`:

```python notest
@per_adapter(
    exclude=[ExcludedAdapter(Adapter.LANGGRAPH, "it is the fixed peer here")],
    peer=Adapter.LANGGRAPH,
    prompt=REPLY_PROMPT,
)
async def test_foreign_peer(cell, peer, resource_manager, user_ops, reply_capture):
    marker = unique_marker("note")
    a = await cell.provision(f"a-{cell.adapter_id}")          # A (fanned)
    b = await peer.provision(f"b-{peer.adapter_id}")          # B (a different framework)
    room_id = await resource_manager.provision_room(participants=[a.id, b.id])

    # B authors one message mentioning A that carries the marker (so it enters A's
    # agent-scoped /context), then stops. (The real test factors this into a helper.)
    b_prompt = f"{REPLY_PROMPT} Send exactly one message that mentions {a.name} and contains this token: {marker}"
    async with peer.run_as(b, prompt=b_prompt):
        async with reply_capture(room_id) as capture:
            probe = capture.messages.snapshot()
            mid = await user_ops.send_message(room_id, "pass a note", mention_id=b.id, mention_name=b.name)
            replies = await capture.wait_for_reply(mid, b.id, since=probe)
            replies.mentioning(a.id).assert_contains_any([marker])  # setup precondition

    async with cell.run_as(a):                                   # A cold-boots → rehydrates B's message
        async with reply_capture(room_id) as capture:

            mid = await user_ops.send_message(room_id, "what token did they send?", mention_id=a.id, mention_name=a.name)
            replies = await capture.wait_for_reply(mid, a.id, since=mark)
            replies.assert_contains_any([marker])
```

## Wiring fences (fail at collection, before any live agent)

The topology is guarded two ways so a mis-wired test never false-greens:

- **`assert_agent_fixtures_wired`** (`agent_wiring.py`, run from the collection hook)
  raises a `UsageError` for any of: `cell` requested without `@per_adapter`;
  `agent`/`agents` requested with no decorator; `agents` under `@per_adapter` (a
  cell is one adapter — use `agent`); `cell` under `@with_adapters` (fan-only);
  both decorators on one test; `agent` and `cell` both requested; a hand-rolled
  `parametrize("adapter_id")` with no `@per_adapter`.
- **`@per_adapter` raises at import** if its filters select **no** adapters (an
  empty `parametrize` would skip silently — fail-loud forbids that). A bare
  `@per_adapter()` is never empty.
- **`ResourceManager.track_running`** raises if one identity is already running,
  blocking overlapping/nested runs of a single identity (the classic reboot bug);
  the id is released in `finally`, so a failed startup never wedges it.

## "I want to..." -> use this (do not reinvent)

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Run a specific named agent | `@with_adapters(Adapter.ANTHROPIC)` → `agent` (or `agents` for several); auto-gates + runs + reaps |
| Run a standard prompt/features shape | `@with_adapters(Adapter.X, **TOOL_AGENT)` / `**MEMORY_AGENT` — don't re-spell `prompt=`/`features=` |
| Run the same scenario across every adapter | `@per_adapter()` → `agent` (id via `agent.adapter_id`) |
| Run a scenario across a subset | `@per_adapter(Adapter.X, Adapter.Y)` (positional = include) / `@per_adapter(exclude= by id, supports=/without={Capability.MEMORY} by capability, or runs_tool_loop=True for the custom-tool subgroup)`; add `prompt=`/`features=` (or `**MEMORY_AGENT`) to steer |
| Drive the agent lifecycle myself (build-only / reboot / rehydration) | `@per_adapter()` → `cell` (`cell.build()` / `cell.provision()` / `cell.run_as()` — see **AdapterCell**) |
| Clean up what I created | nothing: `resource_manager` reaps on teardown (`BAND_E2E_AUTOCLEAN=false` keeps it for debugging) |
| Drive the platform as a user | the `user_ops` fixture (`UserOps`) |
| List who the user could invite to a room | `await user_ops.lookup_peers(not_in_room=room_id)` → `list[Peer]` (the invitable roster; `peer_type="Agent"` narrows) |
| Drive a peer agent (e.g. the `Echo` bounce) | `await resource_manager.peer(peer).send_message(room_id, "ECHO: ...", mention_id=agent.id, mention_name=agent.name)` — posts as that agent, returns the message id to barrier on (needs the peer already in the room) |
| Observe replies without a race | `async with reply_capture(room_id) as capture:` then send |
| Get an agent's reply to assert on | `replies = await capture.wait_for_reply(mid, agent_id[, since=])` — waits for the recipient's reply frame, returns it |
| Know a turn finished (reply optional; reading durable state) | `await capture.wait_for_processed(mid, agent_id)` |
| Wait for a specific delivery state (e.g. a failure) | `await capture.wait_for_delivery(mid, agent_id, until={DeliveryStatus.FAILED})` |
| Inspect the delivery lifecycle | `capture.delivery_status(mid, agent_id)` / `capture.delivery_history(mid, agent_id)` |
| Wait on a custom condition | `await capture.wait_until(predicate)` |
| Scope a read to a later turn (reused capture) | `mark = capture.messages.snapshot()` before sending; `capture.messages.since(mark)` after the barrier |
| See which tools fired (with args) | `calls = await capture.tool_calls(sender_id=agent.id)` after the barrier (needs `Emit.TOOL_CALLS`; memory tools excluded — `include_memory=True` or `capture.memory(agent)`) |
| Assert a specific tool fired | `calls.assert_fired("name", with_args={...})` (case-insensitive, subset args) |
| See which events an agent emitted | `await capture.thoughts(sender_id=agent.id)` (or `errors()`/`tasks()`/`events(MessageType.X)`) |
| Assert an event was emitted | `thoughts.assert_present()` / `thoughts.assert_contains_any([marker])` |
| Observe an agent's memory (both layers) | `mem = await capture.memory(agent, content_query=marker)` after the barrier |
| Assert a memory op was called / a record landed | `mem.calls.assert_store_called(...)` / `mem.stored.assert_stored(content=marker, ...)` |
| Assert something happened (cheap) | the `Replies` assertion methods on `capture.messages` |
| Assert a fuzzy/semantic outcome | the `judge` fixture (sparingly — see Assertion strategy) |
| Declare extra requirements explicitly | `@requires(Dep.OPENAI, ...)` (missing one **fails**) — but `@with_adapters`/`@per_adapter` already do this for the agents they build |

## Assertion strategy: cheap checks first, judge last

Prefer the cheapest assertion that proves the point. The LLM judge costs tokens,
adds latency, and is itself non-deterministic, so do not reach for it by reflex.

1. Structural facts -> the tolerant assertion methods on `capture.messages`
   (`Replies`): `assert_present`, `assert_at_least`, `assert_contains_any`,
   `assert_contains_none` (the tolerant negative — no forbidden value present),
   `assert_mentions` (and the matching ones on `Events`/`Memories`). Free,
   instant, deterministic.
2. Only when the outcome is genuinely semantic (paraphrase-proof "did it greet?",
   "did it recall both facts?") -> the `judge` fixture.

Use the structural assertions as a fast pre-check before the judge, as the smoke
tests do. If a substring or metadata check can express the assertion, use it
instead of the judge.

## Conventions

- Waits are event-driven and deterministic. Never `sleep` or poll a fixed window.
- `deadline_s` is a failure deadline only (raises `TimeoutError`); never a success signal.
- `wait_for_processed(message_id, agent_id)` is the way to know an agent *turn* is done.
  It reads the platform's `message_updated` delivery state — the same signal the
  runtime itself uses — so it never depends on the agent's reply text. Per-room
  FIFO processing means barriering on the last message you sent proves every earlier
  message was handled. Use it before reading durable turn state (tool calls, usage,
  events, memory). (No probe message is needed — `send_message` returns the id to
  barrier on.)
- `wait_for_reply(message_id, agent_id, ...)` is the barrier to use when you then assert
  on the **reply text**. `processed` does **not** imply the reply is buffered: the reply
  (`message_created`) and the delivery-status (`message_updated`) are independent,
  unordered platform events, so `processed` can arrive first. `wait_for_reply` waits for
  the reply frame itself and returns it — assert on the return value, not by re-reading
  `capture.messages` right after `wait_for_processed` (that races the reply).

## Waiting on delivery state (`DeliveryStatus`)

Each message carries a per-recipient delivery state, exposed as
`band.client.streaming.DeliveryStatus`. The backend lifecycle is:

```
DELIVERED -> PROCESSING -> PROCESSED | FAILED
```

`FAILED` is **not** terminal — the platform retries (bounded by max retries), so a
message may cycle `FAILED -> PROCESSING` again before reaching `PROCESSED`.
`PROCESSED` is the only success terminal.

```python notest
mid = await user_ops.send_message(room_id, "...", mention_id=a.id, mention_name=a.name)

# Success barrier (the common case): wait until PROCESSED. Waits through any
# transient FAILED; on timeout it reports the last status + attempt error.
await capture.wait_for_processed(mid, a.id)

# Any specific state(s): the general waiter, returns the DeliveryStatus reached.
reached = await capture.wait_for_delivery(mid, a.id, until={DeliveryStatus.FAILED})

# Inspect after the fact (no waiting):
capture.delivery_status(mid, a.id)        # current state, or None if unseen
capture.delivery_history(mid, a.id)       # e.g. [PROCESSING, PROCESSED]
```

Note: `DELIVERED` is set at rest but is not pushed as its own WebSocket frame — in
practice the first observed transition is `PROCESSING`. Do not wait on `DELIVERED`.

## Tool-observation inspection (`tool_calls` + `assert_fired`)

After a turn settles (barrier on the trigger id with `wait_for_processed`), read the
agent's tool calls and assert what fired:

```python notest
mid = await user_ops.send_message(room_id, "...", mention_id=a.id, mention_name=a.name)
await capture.wait_for_processed(mid, a.id)
calls = await capture.tool_calls(sender_id=a.id)   # a ToolCalls (list[ToolCall])
calls.assert_fired("get_weather", with_args={"place": "Zorath"})
```

This reads the persisted `tool_call` events (so the agent must run with
`Emit.TOOL_CALLS` — use `**TOOL_AGENT`-style features), not a live subscription. It is
race-free: the platform marks the trigger `processed` only after the reply is
emitted, by which point the turn's tool-call events are already persisted.
`assert_fired` is tolerant — name matches case-insensitively and `with_args` is a
subset/substring match. Pass `sender_id` to scope to one agent and `since` (a server
timestamp) to scope to one turn when reusing a capture. See `smoke/inspection/test_tool_calls.py`
and `smoke/behavior/test_isolation.py`.

By default `tool_calls()` **excludes memory tools** (mirroring the SDK's
`BASE_TOOL_NAMES = ALL_TOOL_NAMES - MEMORY_TOOL_NAMES` split). Pass
`include_memory=True`, or use `capture.memory(agent)` for the dedicated memory view.

## Emitted-event inspection

`capture.thoughts()` / `errors()` / `tasks()` (or generic `capture.events(MessageType.X)`)
return an `Events` collection on the same read-after-barrier contract as `tool_calls`.
Drive them with the built-in `band_send_event` tool (no `Emit.*` feature needed; the
tool posts directly). `assert_present()` and `assert_contains_any([marker])` are the
assertions; assert the **marker** (not bare presence), since adapters auto-emit a
generic `error` event on any turn exception. See `smoke/inspection/test_events.py`.

## Memory inspection

`capture.memory(agent)` reads both observable layers in one call, returning a
`MemoryObservation`:

- **Call layer** — `mem.calls` (a `MemoryToolCalls`), from the room's `tool_call`
  events: `mem.calls.assert_store_called(scope=..., system=..., type=...)`,
  `assert_list_called()`, etc. Needs `Emit.TOOL_CALLS` (use `**MEMORY_AGENT`).
- **Store layer** — `mem.stored` (a `Memories`) of records that *actually landed*,
  from the memories API: `mem.stored.where(scope=..., system=...)` +
  `.assert_stored(...)` / `.assert_present()` / `.assert_none()`.

`memory()` takes the agent handle because the store layer needs the agent's own key.
Drive a store with `band_store_memory`, read after the barrier; a unique marker keeps
the read collision-free. Memory tools are an enterprise opt-in (entitled org). See
`smoke/inspection/test_memory.py`.

## Validation policy: fail on missing requirements, never skip

A test that needs a key/CLI/server and can't find it **fails** — it does not skip.
Skipping on missing config hides misconfiguration as a false green. The only
legitimate skip is `E2E_TESTS_ENABLED` (the on/off switch for the whole live suite);
`BAND_API_KEY_USER` missing while E2E is enabled **fails** (the always-on gate), and
any `@requires(Dep.X)` requirement **fails** when absent, naming the missing env
var/CLI/server. Consequence: no single environment turns the full adapter matrix
green in one job (crewai needs its own venv; codex/opencode/letta need a backend) —
a red cell means "this backend isn't wired up", which is intended. The one
deliberate exception is **lane scoping** (`BAND_E2E_LANE`, see CI lanes below): an
*out-of-lane* adapter *skips with a reason* (it's covered by its own lane, so this
is sharding, not hiding), while an **in-lane** adapter with a missing key/backend
still fails.

## CI lanes (a lane = one CI job)

A **lane** is a CI job: a `uv` extra to install plus, for a lane with a server/CLI,
the setup that stands it up. Each registered adapter belongs to exactly one lane,
**derived from its `requires`** (`dep_lane` in `deps.py` → the unique
non-default lane among its deps). `ci_lanes()` (`toolkit/ci_lanes.py`) groups every
adapter into a `CILane(id, extra, adapters, linux_only)` — so a newly-registered
adapter joins its lane for free, and the `assert_every_adapter_has_a_ci_home()` guard
fails loudly if one lands nowhere. `linux_only` (from `LINUX_ONLY_LANES`) marks a lane
whose backend can't run off Linux, so the workflow drops its Windows cells.

Lane ids are **content-based** (what the lane runs) and **decoupled from the `uv`
extra** a lane installs (`Lane` → `Extra` via `LANE_EXTRAS`): several lanes share
the `dev` extra but are split out for isolation.

| Lane | `uv` extra | Adapters | Backend the CI job provides |
|------|-----------|----------|------------------------------|
| `core` | `dev` | anthropic, claude_sdk, agno, langgraph, pydantic_ai, copilot_sdk | provider keys (secrets); copilot_sdk self-downloads its CLI runtime and uses Anthropic BYOK without GitHub auth |
| `crewai` | `dev-crewai` | crewai, crewai_flow | provider keys; isolated venv (crewai conflicts with `dev`'s deps — `pyproject.toml [tool.uv] conflicts`) |
| `google` | `dev` | gemini, google_adk | provider keys; split from `core` so Google free-tier rate-limit flakiness is isolated |
| `backends` | `dev` | codex, opencode, copilot_acp | the CLI/server coding agents in one job: the `codex` CLI + login + a disposable `CODEX_CWD` (+ the codex-acp e2e), a running `opencode serve` (`OPENCODE_BASE_URL`, gating `bash` to `ask` → `E2E_OPENCODE_BASH_ASKS`), and the `copilot` CLI (`Dep.COPILOT_CLI` + `Dep.ANTHROPIC` — Anthropic BYOK; optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the single Copilot-hosted auth smoke) |
| `letta` | `dev` | letta | a self-hosted Letta server (docker — `.github/scripts/setup-letta.sh`); the adapter self-hosts its Band MCP server inside pytest (see "Letta lane" below). **Linux-only** (`LINUX_ONLY_LANES`) — no Windows cells |
| `parlant` | `dev-parlant` | *(none — parlant is a bespoke smoke, not a registered matrix adapter; pinned via `@lane(Lane.PARLANT)`)* | provider keys; isolated venv (parlant's `griffe`/`griffelib` transitive deps collide with pydantic_ai's — `pyproject.toml [tool.uv] conflicts`); no server setup — the smoke spins up its own in-process Parlant server |

`backends` folds codex + opencode into one job (both install `dev`, differ only in
the backend their job stands up) so a job-per-backend isn't needed; the cost is that
one backend failing to come up can redden the other's cells (the per-adapter report
still shows which). `google` gets its own lane so Google free-tier rate-limit
flakiness is isolated; `letta` stands alone for the live Letta server its job stands up;
`parlant` stands alone because its own venv can't share a resolved environment with
`pydantic_ai` (unlike every other split above, this one is a packaging conflict, not
an isolation choice) — see `deps.py`'s `LANE_EXTRAS` seed comment for why `ci_lanes()`
has to special-case it in (parlant registers no matrix adapter, so nothing would
otherwise place this lane).

**The knob:** `BAND_E2E_LANE=<lane id>`. Scheduling is *derived*: a test's lane is the
home lane of **all** the frameworks it touches — a matrix cell's adapter (plus its
`peer=`, if any), or a `@with_adapters` group's set. When `BAND_E2E_LANE` is set,
`lane_selection.apply_lane_skips` (called by the conftest hook) marks
**skip-with-reason** every test whose (single) home lane isn't the active one. An
**in-lane** adapter is left untouched, so a missing key/CLI/server still **fails** via
its `@requires` gate (an unwired lane is red by design until its setup lands).
Adapter-agnostic tests always run. **Unset** (the local default) runs the full matrix,
fail-loud.

**Home ≠ hosting.** An adapter's *home* lane is where its single-framework cells run;
*hosting* is which lanes' `uv` extra can actually install a framework (`hosting_lanes`
in `toolkit/ci_lanes.py`: every `dev` lane hosts every `dev` framework; `dev-crewai`
hosts only the crewai stack). A test whose frameworks share one home lane runs there.
A test whose frameworks span **more than one** home lane is hosted by no single job by
default, so `assert_every_item_is_schedulable` (the same hook) **fails collection** for
it — the fail-loud guard against a test that would silently skip in every lane (false
green). The escape hatch is `@lane(Lane.X)` (from `agents`), which pins such a test to
one lane — and the guard **validates** that `Lane.X` actually *hosts* all its
frameworks, so a typo'd, unknown, or wrong-extra pin fails collection too (not a
silent skip). A single-framework cell never trips this; a same-lane `peer=` (e.g. two
`core` frameworks, as in `smoke/matrix/test_rehydration_cross_framework.py`) is
schedulable as-is.

**Run locally:**

```bash
uv sync --extra dev            # the core/google/backends/letta venv
BAND_E2E_LANE=core E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true \
  uv run pytest tests/e2e/baseline/ -v -s --no-cov

uv sync --extra dev-crewai     # the crewai lane (overwrites the env)
BAND_E2E_LANE=crewai E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true \
  uv run pytest tests/e2e/baseline/ -v -s --no-cov
```

**CI** (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) lists no adapters: a `lanes` job emits the
partition from `ci_lanes()` as `[{lane, extra}, …]` and the `e2e` job fans one job
per lane (`uv sync --extra <extra>` + `BAND_E2E_LANE=<lane>`), running each lane's
setup steps gated on its `matrix.lane` id. Manual dispatch also takes a `lane` input
(a dropdown, default `all`) validated against the registry, to run one lane on demand.
Adding an adapter to an existing lane needs no YAML edit. Coverage is the union of
all lanes.

### Adding a CI lane

Lanes live in the registry, not the workflow YAML. To add one:

1. **`toolkit/deps.py`** — add a `Lane` member (a content-based id) and map
   it to its `uv` extra in `LANE_EXTRAS` (add an `Extra` member first if it's a new
   extra — and declare that extra in `pyproject.toml [project.optional-dependencies]`).
2. **`toolkit/deps.py`** — point a `Dep` at the lane via `lane=Lane.<NEW>` in
   `_DEPS` (provider-key deps with no isolation need ride `DEFAULT_LANE`). The
   adapters whose `requires` include that dep now resolve into the new lane; the
   guards (`assert_every_adapter_has_a_ci_home`, the partition test) keep it honest.
3. **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`** — only if the lane needs a server/CLI: add a
   `.github/scripts/setup-<backend>.sh` (export any discovered config via
   `$GITHUB_ENV`; see the codex/opencode scripts) and a step that runs it
   gated on its `matrix.lane` id. Add the lane id to the `lane` dispatch-input
   `options` so it's selectable, and update the header comment's lane list. (The
   common env setup — git/uv/python — is the shared `./.github/actions/setup-e2e`
   composite, so a new lane doesn't repeat it.)
4. **Validate:** `assert_workflow_lane_gates_known()` ties every `matrix.lane ==`
   gate back to the registry, and `assert_workflow_lane_options_match_registry()`
   ties the dispatch `lane` dropdown to it — so a typo'd/stale gate, or a dropdown
   that's missing the new lane (or still lists a removed one), fails loudly in the
   guard suite on every PR rather than silently never running / never being
   selectable.

## Scorecard (the adapter×test artifact)

One place to see **adapter × test → pass / fail / skip / N-A (+ reason)**. An excluded
adapter would otherwise vanish from the results (`specs()` omits it, no test node) with
its reason buried in a comment; the scorecard makes the full grid observable and gives
CI a queryable N-A instead of a silent gap.

- **Reasons live at the call site.** `@per_adapter(exclude=…)` takes
  `ExcludedAdapter(adapter, reason)` records — a non-empty reason is required at
  decoration time (`ExcludedAdapter.__post_init__`), so an adapter can never be excluded
  without saying why. The records ride the `PerAdapter` marker, so collection can read
  them back.
- **Emission is settings-driven.** Set `BAND_E2E_SCORECARD_JSON=<path>` and the session
  writes that run's rows at the end — collected cells' pass/fail (read from each test
  report, keyed by exact nodeid — no junit scraping), out-of-lane cells as `skip`, and
  the `@per_adapter` exclusions as `na` with their reasons. Empty (the local default)
  emits nothing.
- **CI folds the lanes together and gates on the result.** Each `e2e` lane writes its
  own slice to `artifacts/scorecard-<lane>-<os>.json` and uploads it; the final
  `scorecard` job merges them (`python -m tests.e2e.baseline.scorecard merge … --out …
  --markdown … --expected-lanes …`) into one `artifacts/scorecard.json` (+ a markdown
  grid, also written to the run's step summary). A cell runs in exactly one lane, so
  the union keeps its real outcome over the `skip`s and never clobbers an `na`.

The logic (`na_rows` / `outcome_row` / `merge` / `gate`) lives in `scorecard.py` as pure
functions (unit-tested in `tests/framework_conformance/test_scorecard.py`); the
conftest is a thin `pytest_runtest_logreport` / `pytest_sessionfinish` delegate.

### CI gating & flake policy

The suite runs nightly (`e2e.yml`'s `schedule:` cron), full lane × OS matrix,
unattended. A `workflow_dispatch` with the default `lane: all` / `os: all` reproduces
that run exactly — it is not a lesser "manual mode." Only a *scoped* dispatch (one
lane and/or one OS) skips the parts below that assume the full matrix ran.

**Fail-loud rule** (`gate()` in `scorecard.py`): a `fail` cell reddens the run. A
`skip` cell reddens it too, but only if its home lane (from `ci_lanes()` — see "CI
lanes" above) was one of this invocation's `--expected-lanes`; a `skip` from a lane
that was never selected this run is simply out of scope. `na` (+ reason) always
passes. A cell-level gate can't see a whole OS leg of an expected lane producing *zero*
scorecard fragment (`ScorecardRow` carries no OS dimension) — the `scorecard` job's
final "Compute gate verdict" step backstops that by also failing whenever
`needs.e2e.result != 'success'`.

That backstop is also the *only* net for a bespoke `@lane`-pinned smoke (parlant,
and the non-`@per_adapter` tests in `backends`/`letta`) — this is a pre-existing
property of the scorecard module, not something this gate changes: `outcome_row`
only recognizes a nodeid whose `[…]` parametrization is a registered adapter id
(`_ADAPTER_IDS`), so a bespoke smoke never produces a `ScorecardRow` at all and is
structurally invisible to the cell-level grid. It is still covered — just at the
coarser matrix-leg granularity, not the per-cell one the grid markets.

A subtlety worth calling out for on-call: once `release-gate.yml` has recorded a
*failure*, GitHub does not automatically re-check it just because a later nightly run
posts a fresh green `baseline-green` status — a required check's completed run is final
until something re-triggers it (a new commit, or a manual "re-run failed jobs" on the
release PR). This is ordinary GitHub required-check behavior, not a gap specific to
this workflow; if the release PR is stuck red after main has actually gone green,
re-run the check by hand.

Two reporting jobs (`mark-baseline`, `report-scoped-run`) are gated on `!cancelled()`
rather than `always()`. They write externally visible state — a commit status, and a
comment on the tested commit — and a *cancelled* run is not evidence of anything:
under `always()`, a nightly whose legs were cancelled mid-flight (the per-(lane,OS)
concurrency group, or a human cancelling the run) would report the baseline as red
with nothing actually broken. Declining to report is the safe direction, since the
release gate treats an absent status as blocking anyway. A `timeout-minutes` leg kill
does *not* cancel the run, so a genuine hang still reddens.

**Flake policy — two layers, deliberately not automatic-override-on-a-timer:**

1. **Per-test** (`flaky.py`, already existed before this policy): `flaky_model`
   reruns a test whose failure can be genuine LLM non-determinism (an `AssertionError`
   is retried too — a capable model's bad moment); `flaky_infra` reruns only
   non-assertion failures (timeouts, cold starts) and lets an `AssertionError` fail
   loud immediately, since that's a real bug. Every flaky-prone test carries an
   explicit kind + reason (`assert_flaky_is_classified` rejects a raw
   `@pytest.mark.flaky`).
2. **Per-lane** (`e2e.yml`'s run step): if the lane's first pytest invocation has any
   failure at all, it reruns only the failed nodeids once (`--last-failed --lfnf=none`)
   before the scorecard is written. This absorbs a whole-lane transient (e.g. a
   rate-limit window) that per-test taxonomy wouldn't catch on its own; a genuine bug
   still fails the rerun and reddens the gate (`ScorecardCollector`'s "last write wins"
   is exactly this rerun's final report being the cell's real outcome). `--lfnf=none` is
   load-bearing, not decoration: pytest's default for "`--last-failed` with no
   lastfailed cache" is to run *everything*, so an attempt 1 that died without
   recording a failed nodeid (collection error, import-time raise, OOM kill) would
   silently promote the retry into a second full live lane — double the provider spend
   and wall clock against a leg that carries a wall-clock cap. With the flag, such a
   retry deselects everything and exits 5, which the script reads as "nothing to retry"
   and keeps attempt 1's verdict.

No time-boxed automatic override is layered on top of either — a lane stuck failing
on a real provider outage does not silently start passing after N nights. The
deliberate manual-override path is the `main-branch-protection` ruleset's existing
`OrganizationAdmin` bypass actor, used the same way any other required-check override
would be.

**Per-leg timeout:** `e2e.yml`'s `e2e` job carries a `timeout-minutes` cap — without
it, GitHub's own default (360 minutes) is the only ceiling on a genuinely stuck leg.
The workflow is the single source of that number; this section deliberately does not
restate it, and neither does the digest text, so there is no second copy to go stale.
Sizing it is a real trade-off in both directions: too loose and a hung leg burns
runner time to no purpose, but too tight is worse than it looks — GitHub reports a
timeout as `cancelled`, which the gate treats exactly like a failure, so a cap that
clips legs which were still making progress *manufactures* red baselines and trains
people to ignore the signal. It was raised from an initial 120 after a full-matrix run
showed healthy legs still working past 90 minutes. Verified live that GitHub reports a
`timeout-minutes` kill as conclusion `cancelled`, not `failure` — `MATRIX_OK` in
`compute-gate-verdict.sh` only checks equality with `success`, so a timeout reddens
the gate the same as an outright failure with no extra handling, and the nightly
digest's warning line names "failed, crashed, or hit its time cap" explicitly rather
than only "crashed."

**`baseline-green` + the release gate:** on a full-matrix run, `e2e.yml`'s
`mark-baseline` job posts a `baseline-green` commit status (success/failure) on the
tested commit. `.github/workflows/release-gate.yml` is a separate, narrow,
PR-triggered check: an instant no-op for every ordinary PR, and for the standing
release-please PR it consults that status and fails the PR's check until the baseline
is green. This is *not* the same thing as making the whole E2E suite a required PR
check (explicitly out of scope; PR-level gating is covered by the existing Tier-1
checks) — only this thin lookup is required on every PR, so the cost stays negligible
for the 99% of PRs that aren't the release PR.

It gates on the most recently **tested** commit of the base branch, not the live tip
(`.github/scripts/check-release-baseline.sh`). A nightly marks exactly one commit —
whatever main's tip was at 03:17 UTC — so a tip-only check would go red the instant
anything merged after that nightly, leaving the gate red by default and training people
to bypass rather than trust it. The script walks the branch newest-first (bounded by
`COMMIT_SCAN_LIMIT`, default 40 commits) for the most recent commit carrying a
`baseline-green` status, and blocks unless that verdict is `success`. Two bounds keep it
honest: a non-green verdict blocks, and a green one older than `MAX_BASELINE_AGE_DAYS`
(default 7) stops vouching, so a long-dead nightly can't certify today's main. Both the
producer and the consumer read the status context name from
`.github/scripts/baseline-status-context.sh`, so the two sides cannot drift apart —
a typo in a re-typed literal would fail silently, blocking the release PR forever with
nothing to point at.

**Nightly digest:** the same job also posts a compact digest (pass or fail) as a
**comment on the tested commit** — not a GitHub Issue (this repo doesn't use them);
GitHub still delivers a mention notification/email off a commit comment exactly as
it would off an issue comment, which is the only reason this exists. The comment
individually mentions each `band-ai/integrations` member, listed in
`.github/integrations-team.txt` (one GitHub username per line) — verified live that a
bot-authored `@org/team` mention does not reliably fan out a per-member notification,
even with every member's own settings correctly configured, so individual mentions
are what actually delivers. The roster lives in that plain data file rather than
inline in the workflow so updating membership never means editing YAML. GitHub's own
mention-notification delivery emails each one per their own account settings, so
there's no mailer to stand up and no email address this repo ever has to see or
store. The digest (`digest_body` in `scorecard.py`) is deliberately *not* the wide
adapter×test grid — a real run spans every registered adapter (15+ columns as of this
writing) across all lanes, which is fine full-width in the step summary but turns
into an unreadable wall in a notification email. It's a small GFM counts table
(Passed/Failed/N-A/Skipped) plus only the problem cells (failing / missing, listed
separately), plus a link back to the run for the full grid — GitHub's comment/email
renderer sanitizes out `<style>`/inline CSS, so plain GFM (tables, bold, bullets) is
the ceiling for styling here; `post-baseline-digest.sh` also adds a shields.io
PASS/FAIL badge image alongside the bold emoji+text header (the bold text is the
guaranteed-to-render fallback for mail clients that block remote images by default).
Its PASS/FAIL header is built by the workflow from the job's combined verdict
(`$PASSED`), not read off the cell-level digest — a matrix-leg crash the cell grid
can't see (no OS dimension on `ScorecardRow`) can flip that verdict in a way the
digest content alone wouldn't show, so the workflow says so explicitly when it
happens rather than let the email quietly disagree with the `baseline-green` commit
status.

**Scoped manual reports:** a manual dispatch that selects one lane and/or OS posts
the same compact digest as a comment on that commit and mentions only the person who
initiated it. Its header names the selected scope and explicitly says it does not
certify the full baseline; it never writes `baseline-green`.

**Local preview:** `scripts/preview-baseline-digest.sh [pass|fail] [nightly|manual]`
posts a real comment in seconds without waiting on E2E, against local HEAD (which
must already be pushed — the commit-comments API 404s on a SHA the remote doesn't
have). It fabricates a tiny scorecard and drives the same
`.github/scripts/post-baseline-digest.sh` path CI uses, so formatting cannot drift.
`nightly` (the default) pings the roster; `manual` mentions only the current GitHub
user. Use either sparingly.

## Letta lane

Letta runs the `@per_adapter` matrix in its own `letta` lane, with one
documented exclusion: `test_concurrent_same_adapter_instances_each_reply` —
the Letta server materializes MCP tools globally by name, so co-resident
same-process instances cross-wire their sends (see that test's module doc).
Its platform tools execute over MCP, so a cell has three hops:

1. **Adapter → Letta server** — `LettaAdapter` drives the Letta server over REST.
2. **Letta server → self-hosted MCP server** — the adapter starts the SDK's
   in-process `LocalMCPServer` and registers its advertised URL with Letta,
   which calls back over SSE at `host.docker.internal` (the dockerized server's
   route to the pytest host).
3. **Tools execute in-process** as the provisioned agent, with its own key.

Run locally (the setup script also works outside CI):

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... GITHUB_ENV=/dev/null .github/scripts/setup-letta.sh
export LETTA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8283   # plus OPENAI_API_KEY in the test env

E2E_TESTS_ENABLED=true BAND_E2E_LANE=letta \
  uv run pytest tests/e2e/baseline/ -v -s --no-cov
```

Use the script rather than a bare `docker run`: besides the host-gateway alias
and the health-wait, it relaxes Letta's MCP URL guard inside the container —
Letta rejects any MCP hostname resolving to a non-public IP, and the callback
to the in-pytest server is a private (docker-host) IP by definition. Without
the patch, tool discovery silently returns zero tools and every cell fails.

Knobs:

- a self-hosted `LETTA_BASE_URL` needs `OPENAI_API_KEY`; a Letta Cloud URL needs
  `LETTA_API_KEY` instead (the `Dep.LETTA` gate).
- `LETTA_MCP_ADVERTISED_HOST` (default `host.docker.internal`) — the host Letta
  dials to reach the in-pytest MCP server; set `127.0.0.1` for a natively-run
  Letta. The builder binds `0.0.0.0` only for a non-loopback advertised host.
- `MCP_SERVER_URL` — switch to an external band-mcp (the Letta Cloud /
  production topology) instead of the self-hosted default.

CI stands the server up via `.github/scripts/setup-letta.sh` (docker run with
the host-gateway alias, health-wait on `GET /v1/health/`, the MCP URL guard
patch, exports `LETTA_BASE_URL`).

**Linux-only lane (no Windows cells).** The letta lane runs on Linux only. Its
server has no Windows story on the `windows-latest` runner: the `letta/letta`
image is Linux-only (that runner only runs Windows containers), and Letta's own
install guide supports a native install on macOS / Linux / WSL only, not raw
Windows ([docs.letta.com/guides/server/source](https://docs.letta.com/guides/server/source)).
So `letta` is listed in `LINUX_ONLY_LANES` (`toolkit/deps.py`) and the e2e
workflow emits no `letta × windows` cell — every other lane runs on both OSes.

`e2e_pending` (which once excluded Letta) is now a reason *string*
(`str | None`), pinned to an allowlist — empty today — in
`tests/framework_conformance/test_agent_wiring_rules.py`.
