"""Conformance test that the text adapters advertise came from the master models.

``runtime/tools/`` is the single source of truth for what an LLM reads about
a platform tool: the input model's docstring is the tool description and each
``Field(description=...)`` is an argument description. An adapter can lose that
in two ways, and both have shipped: retyping the text locally (where it drifts)
or handing the framework a schema shape that carries no argument text at all.

An adapter opts in by setting ``AdapterConfig.advertised_arg_text`` to a probe
returning what it really advertises. Adapters that pass the master schema
through untouched leave it unset — see the field's docstring.
