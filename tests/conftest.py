"""Pytest fixtures for Band SDK tests.

Most fixtures are provided by the thenvoi_testing package.

Available from thenvoi_testing:
- factory: MockDataFactory for creating test data
- mock_agent_api, mock_human_api, mock_api_client: API client mocks
- mock_websocket: WebSocket client mock
- fake_agent_tools: FakeAgentTools for adapter testing
- sample_room_message, sample_agent_message: Message payloads

This file contains SDK-specific fixtures and event helpers that must
return SDK-native types for pattern matching compatibility.
