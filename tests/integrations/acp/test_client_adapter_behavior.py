"""Behavioral tests: ACPClientAdapter driven against an in-process fake ACP agent.

Unlike the mocked-connection tests in ``test_client_adapter.py`` (which seed the
chunk buffer directly), these run the adapter's real ``on_started`` / ``on_message``
path over a **real ACP connection** — a socketpair wiring the adapter's client to a
scripted fake agent. So genuine JSON-RPC framing, the session lifecycle, the
permission round-trip, and ``ACPCollectingClient`` chunk parsing are all exercised;
only the "LLM" is faked.

The plumbing lives in ``acp_toolkit``; the fake agent comes from the ``fake_agent``
fixture. Tests read as intent — script the agent, send a message, assert on the
:class:`Reply` (observable effects), not internals.
