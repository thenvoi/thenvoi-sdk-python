"""Chat-send boundary test.

``band.platform.posting.post_message``/``post_event`` is the single choke
point that enforces the platform's content rules (visible-content, the
events content cap) for every agent-side send. A caller that reaches
``create_agent_chat_message``/``create_agent_chat_event`` directly bypasses
those rules -- this scans real source files for such a call outside the
allowlist below, so a new bypass fails a test instead of shipping unguarded.

This scans for the method calls via AST, not imports -- no import-time side
effects, no needing every extra installed.

Two limits worth knowing before trusting it: it only walks ``src/band``, so
``examples/``, ``docker/band_python_kit`` and ``band-bridge`` are unscanned;
and it only matches a direct ``x.<method>(...)`` call, so an aliased bound
method or a ``getattr`` lookup slips past. The human-scope send
(``human_api_messages.send_my_chat_message``) is deliberately not a guarded
name -- it posts through a REST namespace ``post_message``/``post_event``
don't cover, and gets the same visible-content rule from its own input model
(``SendMyChatMessageInput``) instead of from this scan.
