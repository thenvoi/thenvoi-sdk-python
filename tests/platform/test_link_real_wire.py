"""BandLink behavior proven against a real (fake-server-backed) wire, not
mocks -- covers what mocked tests in test_link.py structurally can't: real
Phoenix protocol round trips through WebSocketClient/PHXChannelsClient.

See tests/testing/test_phoenix_server.py for tests of the fake server's own
protocol mechanics (default join outcome, leave acks, push delivery, close
vs. abort semantics); this file is scoped to BandLink-specific behavior the
fake exists to prove.
