"""Band bridge: WS subscriber + event forwarder. No Band logic.

The bridge holds N Band Phoenix WS connections (one per agent identity
in :class:`BridgeConfig.agents`) and forwards every received event as a
JSON payload to the agent's configured target. All semantic work — mention
parsing, message construction, lifecycle marking, participant resolution —
lives in the agent's container, which runs the Band SDK.
