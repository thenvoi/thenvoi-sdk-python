class GracefulShutdown:
    """
    Manages graceful shutdown of a Thenvoi agent via signal handling.

    Catches SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGTERM, and SIGHUP signals and triggers a graceful
    shutdown of the agent, allowing current message processing to complete
    within a configurable timeout.

    Warning:
        The shutdown task created by signal handlers is NOT awaited. This means
        if the process exits immediately after receiving a signal (e.g., due to
        SIGKILL or rapid termination), the graceful shutdown may not complete.
        For guaranteed shutdown completion, use one of these patterns:

        1. Context manager (recommended):
            async with GracefulShutdown(agent, timeout=30.0):
                await agent.run()

        2. Manual await:
            await agent.stop(timeout=30.0)

    Note:
        Signal handlers using asyncio's add_signal_handler() only work on
        Unix systems (Linux, macOS). On Windows, use KeyboardInterrupt
        handling instead (asyncio.run() automatically converts SIGINT to
        KeyboardInterrupt):

            try:
                await agent.run()
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                await agent.stop(timeout=30.0)

    Note:
        SIGHUP is treated as a shutdown signal, NOT a configuration reload
        signal. If your deployment expects SIGHUP for config reload, you
        should not use this handler and implement custom signal handling.

    Note:
        Multiple signals during shutdown: Once a shutdown is initiated, subsequent
        signals are ignored. The shutdown will complete within the configured timeout.
        If you need to force an immediate exit, send SIGKILL (kill -9) instead.

    Example (recommended pattern):
        agent = Agent.create(...)

        async def main():
            shutdown = GracefulShutdown(agent, timeout=30.0)
            shutdown.register_signals()

            try:
                await agent.run()
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                pass  # Normal shutdown

        asyncio.run(main())

    Example (context manager pattern):
        async def main():
            agent = Agent.create(...)

            async with GracefulShutdown(agent, timeout=30.0):
                await agent.run()

    Example (manual signal handling):
        import logging
        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

        agent = Agent.create(...)

        async def main():
            shutdown = GracefulShutdown(agent, timeout=30.0)
