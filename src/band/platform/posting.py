"""Chat message/event posting -- the single REST choke point for sends.

``AgentTools.send_message``/``send_event`` and every other caller that posts
to a room (the A2A/ACP/Slack bridges, the contact hub-room notifier) funnel
through here rather than the raw Fern client directly, so the platform's
content rules (visible-content, the events content cap) are enforced once
for every caller instead of re-implemented per call site.

``rest`` is taken per call, not cached at construction -- same rationale as
``MessageLifecycle``: the caller owns the REST client and may swap it at any
point, so every call here uses whatever ``rest`` the caller currently has.
