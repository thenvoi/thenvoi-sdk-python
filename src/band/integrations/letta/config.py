    Two modes:

    - ``self_host`` (default): the adapter starts an in-process
      ``LocalMCPServer`` and registers it with Letta.  Tool calls execute
      in-process as the adapter's own agent, resolved per room at call time —
      no separate server, no extra credentials.  ``bind_host`` sets the
      listening interface; a non-loopback bind (``"0.0.0.0"``) exposes the
      agent's tools to the local network, so only opt in on an isolated host —
      it is needed when the Letta server runs in a container and reaches back
      via ``host.docker.internal``, which is what ``advertised_host`` names.
    - ``external``: register a separately-run Band MCP server (e.g. band-mcp)
      at ``server_url``.  Required for Letta Cloud, which cannot reach a
      laptop-local server.

    # reused (unique-constraint conflict), and fresh names also keep concurrent
    # adapter instances on one Letta server from cross-wiring their tools.

    # Setting a fixed name in self-host mode skips deregistration on shutdown

    Works with both Letta Cloud and self-hosted Letta.  For Letta Cloud
    (the default), provide a ``provider_key`` and optionally set ``project``
    to scope to a specific project.  For self-hosted, set ``base_url``
    to your server (e.g. ``"http://localhost:8283"``) — no ``provider_key``
    is required.

    Platform tools reach the Letta server over MCP; see ``LettaMCPConfig``
    (``mcp``) for the self-hosted default and the external band-mcp mode.
    ``embedding`` is required by Letta's Docker server on agent create
    (e.g. ``"openai/text-embedding-3-small"``); Letta Cloud picks a default
    when omitted.

    Most fields can also be set via a ``LETTA_``-prefixed environment
    variable (e.g. ``LETTA_BASE_URL``, ``LETTA_MODEL``, ``LETTA_EMBEDDING``);
    ``provider_key`` additionally accepts ``LETTA_API_KEY``, matching Letta
