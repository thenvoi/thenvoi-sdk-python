"""The one MCP tool-registration engine.

Collapses band-mcp's FastMCP-based registrar and ``LocalMCPServer``'s
hand-rolled lowlevel-``Server`` registration into a single, FastMCP-based
engine consumed by two front-door factories:

- ``packages/band-mcp``'s ``standalone_spec(config)`` -- the published CLI.
- ``src/band/integrations/mcp/local_server.py``'s ``embedded_spec(...)`` --
  the in-process front door for opencode/letta/claude_sdk/acp.

Each factory normalizes its door's configuration into a tuple of
``MCPToolRegistration``s (room field already extended/pinned, event-width
override applied, custom tools included) and hands the engine an immutable
``EngineSpec``. ``build_engine`` is a pure function of that spec: it carries
zero door-conditionals -- every per-door difference is resolved by the
factory before the engine ever sees it.

MCP-version isolation: this module is one of the few allowlisted places
``mcp``-package types may appear.
``EngineSpec``, ``MCPToolRegistration``, ``CustomToolSpec``, and
``ToolsResolver`` are themselves framework-neutral -- no ``mcp``-package type
appears in their own fields -- so a v1->v2 migration only has to touch this
module's FastMCP-translation internals, not every caller.
