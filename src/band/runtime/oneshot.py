"""One-shot event handler for request/response hosting.

The SDK's normal flow (``Agent.run()``) assumes a long-lived process that holds
a Band WebSocket subscription. Some hosts can't run that shape — Bedrock
AgentCore Runtime, AWS Lambda, Cloud Run, etc. invoke a container per event and
discard it. For those, a sibling component (the bridge) holds the WS and
forwards events over HTTP.

:class:`OneShotInvoker` is the SDK-side counterpart: one forwarded event in,
one adapter execution out, no per-room state across calls. It mirrors what
:class:`band.runtime.execution.ExecutionContext` does in the long-running
path — self-filter, claim, hydrate, run, mark processed/failed, drain — but
without the asyncio queue + process-loop machinery that would fight a
request/response host.

Bridge envelope shape (see ``bridge_core.bridge.AgentRunner._serialize_event``)::

    {
      "event_type": "message_created" | "room_added" | ...,
      "agent_id": "<recipient agent id>",
      "room_id": "<chat room id or null>",
      "payload": {...},
      "raw": {...},
      "forwarded_at": "ISO-8601"
    }

Example usage::

    link = BandLink(agent_id=..., api_key=..., ws_url=..., rest_url=...)
    adapter = AnthropicAdapter(...)
    invoker = OneShotInvoker(link=link, adapter=adapter, agent_id=...)

    await invoker.startup()
    try:
        result = await invoker.handle_event(forwarded_body)
    finally:
        await invoker.shutdown()
