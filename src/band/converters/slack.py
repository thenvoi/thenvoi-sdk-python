"""History converter for the Slack bridge adapter.

Recovers the Slack thread identity for a room from its history, so the
bridge can resume routing Slack events into the right Band room after
a restart.

History is converted per-room (the platform fetches and converts a single
room's history at a time), so this converter only needs to surface the
binding for the current room. The room_id itself is supplied by the
caller; this converter just answers "is this a Slack-bridged room, and
if so which Slack thread does it mirror?".
